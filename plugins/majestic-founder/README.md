## Philosophy

This plugin focuses on **personal operating systems** for business builders:
- Time and calendar management
- Energy and focus optimization
- Decision-making efficiency
- Sustainable high performance

Unlike `majestic-company` (business operations) or `majestic-sales` (revenue tools), this plugin is about **you** as the operator.

### Pareto Analysis

skill majestic-founder:pareto "My marketing channels"
```
