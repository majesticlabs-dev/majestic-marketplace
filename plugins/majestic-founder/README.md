## Philosophy

This plugin focuses on **personal operating systems** for business builders:
- Time and calendar management
- Energy and focus optimization
- Decision-making efficiency
- Sustainable high performance

Unlike `majestic-company` (business operations) or `majestic-sales` (revenue tools), this plugin is about **you** as the operator.

# Audit your current time allocation

skill majestic-founder:calendar-optimization "I spend 80% of my time in meetings"
```

## Future Roadmap

Planned additions:
- `energy-management` - Peak performance timing and recovery
- `decision-fatigue` - Reduce cognitive load on recurring decisions
- `focus-blocks` - Deep work session design
- `founder-rituals` - Morning/evening routines that compound
