# Pricing Psychology Strategy

anchoring:
  principle: "Present pricing using strategic anchoring to influence perception of value"
  steps:
    - step: 1
      action: "Anchor high first"
      description: "Lead with premium/enterprise tier to set reference point"
    - step: 2
      action: "Recommend middle"
      description: "Guide to mid-tier option (highest margin, best value perception)"
    - step: 3
      action: "Offer downsell"
      description: "Provide entry option for budget-constrained prospects"
  example:
    - tier: "Enterprise"
      price: "$50K"
      note: "Full scale anchor"
    - tier: "Business"
      price: "$30K"
      note: "⭐ Recommended"
    - tier: "Starter"
      price: "$15K"
      note: "Entry option"

psychological_tactics:
  bundle_bonuses:
    principle: "Inflate perceived value without cutting price"
    examples:
      - "Includes $5K in implementation services (marginal cost to you: $500)"
      - "3 months priority support ($2K value)"
      - "Quarterly strategy sessions ($3K value)"

  investment_framing:
    bad: "The cost is $30K"
    good: "The investment is $30K, which delivers $150K in annual value"

  decoy_pricing:
    principle: "Make middle option attractive"
    example:
      - tier: "Premium"
        price: "$50K"
        note: "Only 20% more features than Business"
      - tier: "Business"
        price: "$30K"
        note: "⭐ Looks like better deal"
      - tier: "Starter"
        price: "$15K"
        note: "Missing key features"

value_perception_rules:
  - "Show original price with discount: ~~$35K~~ $30K (creates urgency)"
  - "Bundle related services: Appears higher value than à la carte"
  - "Never apologize for pricing: Confidence signals quality"
