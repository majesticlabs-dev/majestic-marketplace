# Delivery Models & Alternative Proposal Formats

## Trojan Horse Proposal (Exploratory Outline)

For faster close velocity, consider **"Exploratory Outlines"** instead of full proposals.

### When to Use

- Early-stage discussions where full proposal feels premature
- Deals with significant uncertainty or evolving scope
- Prospects who resist traditional sales process
- When you want to turn objections into collaborative refinements

### Template

```markdown
# EXPLORATORY OUTLINE: [Solution] for [Company]

## What We've Heard

Based on our conversations:
- [Pain point 1]
- [Pain point 2]
- [Desired outcome]

## Proposed Direction

Here's one way we could address this:

**Phase 1: [Name]**
- [High-level approach]
- [Key deliverable]
- **Question:** Does this align with your Q[X] goals?

**Phase 2: [Name]**
- [High-level approach]
- [Key deliverable]
- **Question:** Would this timing work for your team?

## Investment Range

Ballpark: $[X] - $[Y]

This depends on:
- [Variable 1]
- [Variable 2]

**Question:** Is this in the range you're thinking?

## Next Steps

Let's refine this together:
1. You review and share feedback
2. We adjust based on your input
3. We formalize into a detailed proposal

**This is a starting point, not a final offer.** What questions does this raise?

## Done-With-You Delivery Model (For $30K+ Deals)

For high-value engagements, offer **hybrid delivery** to accelerate trust and reduce perceived risk.

### What is "Done-With-You"?

Instead of traditional "done-for-you" delivery, co-create initial outputs with their team:

| Traditional Delivery | Done-With-You Delivery |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| We deliver, you implement | We build together |
| Higher perceived risk | Lower risk (you're involved) |
| Black box process | Transparent collaboration |
| Knowledge transfer at end | Learning throughout |

### How It Works

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Joint kickoff workshop
- We facilitate, you participate
- Build initial framework together
- Immediate knowledge transfer

**Phase 2: Co-Creation (Weeks 3-6)**
- Weekly working sessions (2-3 hours)
- We guide, you co-create
- Your team learns by doing
- Real-time feedback and iteration

**Phase 3: Handoff (Weeks 7-8)**
- Transition to independence
- We support, you lead
- Ongoing advisory as needed

### Investment Structure

- Same total investment as done-for-you
- Requires [X] hours/week from your team
- Faster time-to-value due to continuous alignment

*Recommended for: $30K+ engagements where client has internal capacity and wants deeper involvement*
