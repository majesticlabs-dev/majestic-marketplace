# Pricing Psychology Strategy

## Anchoring Principle

Present pricing using strategic anchoring to influence perception of value:

1. **Anchor high first**: Lead with premium/enterprise tier to set reference point
2. **Recommend middle**: Guide to mid-tier option (highest margin, best value perception)
3. **Offer downsell**: Provide entry option for budget-constrained prospects

**Example anchoring sequence:**

```
Enterprise tier: $50K for full scale
↓
Business tier: $30K (⭐ Recommended)
↓
Starter tier: $15K
```

## Psychological Tactics

### Bundle "Bonuses"

Inflate perceived value without cutting price:
- "Includes $5K in implementation services" (marginal cost to you: $500)
- "3 months priority support ($2K value)"
- "Quarterly strategy sessions ($3K value)"

### Frame Investment vs. Cost

- ❌ "The cost is $30K"
- ✅ "The investment is $30K, which delivers $150K in annual value"

### Use Decoy Pricing

Make middle option attractive:
- Premium: $50K (only 20% more features than Business)
- Business: $30K ⭐ (looks like better deal)
- Starter: $15K (missing key features)

## Value Perception Rules

- Show original price with discount: ~~$35K~~ $30K (creates urgency)
- Bundle related services: Appears higher value than à la carte
- Never apologize for pricing: Confidence signals quality
