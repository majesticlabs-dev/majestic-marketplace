# Sales Messaging

Frameworks for crafting compelling sales messages across personas and objections.

## Value Proposition by Persona

| Persona | Role | Pain | Promise | Proof |
|---------|------|------|---------|-------|
| **Economic Buyer** | Budget authority | [Their pain] | [Business outcome] | [ROI, case study] |
| **Champion** | Day-to-day user/advocate | [Their pain] | [Personal outcome] | [Metrics, demo] |
| **User** | End user | [Their pain] | [Experience outcome] | [Trial, testimonial] |
| **Technical Buyer** | Security/IT | [Their pain] | [Risk reduction] | [Compliance, audit] |

## Message Architecture

### Pain-Outcome-Bridge

```
PAIN: "[Prospect], I've been talking to a lot of [role]s at [company type],
and they keep telling me [pain point]."

OUTCOME: "What if you could [desired outcome] without [common sacrifice]?"

BRIDGE: "That's exactly what [Product] does. We help [ICP] achieve
[specific outcome] in [timeframe]."
```

### Feature-Benefit-Impact

| Feature | Benefit | Impact |
|---------|---------|--------|
| [What it does] | [Why it matters] | [Business result] |

**Rule:** Never lead with features. Always: Impact > Benefit > Feature (if asked).

## Objection Handling Matrix

| Objection | Root Cause | Response Strategy |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **"Too expensive"** | ROI unclear | Investment framing + ROI calculator |
| **"We have a solution"** | Switching cost fear | Migration support + quick wins demo |
| **"Not a priority"** | Pain not urgent | Discovery: "What would make it urgent?" |
| **"Need to think about it"** | Missing champion | Enable internal selling with materials |
| **"Need more features"** | Misaligned expectations | Scope confirmation: "Which specifically?" |
| **"Bad timing"** | Resource constraints | Lightweight start option |
| **"Your competitor has X"** | Feature comparison trap | Outcome redirect: "What outcome does X achieve?" |

## Response Framework: Feel-Felt-Found

> "I understand how you feel. Other [similar customers] felt the same way.
> What they found was [outcome after using product]."

## Question-Based Handling

Instead of answering objections directly, ask:
- "Help me understand what's behind that concern?"
- "What would need to be true for this to be a priority?"
- "What's the cost of not solving this in the next [timeframe]?"

## Talk Track Templates

### Cold Call Opening

```
"Hi [Name], this is [You] from [Company].
I know I'm calling out of the blue—do you have 30 seconds?"

[If yes:]
"I work with [role]s at [company types] who [pain point].
We help them [outcome].
Is that something you're dealing with right now?"
```

### Discovery Opening

```
"Before we dive in, I want to make sure I understand your situation.
Can you walk me through [current process/challenge]?"
```

### Demo Transition

```
"Based on what you've shared—[pain 1], [pain 2], and [goal]—
let me show you specifically how we solve those.
I'll focus on [3 key areas] and you can stop me anytime with questions."
```

## Messaging Don'ts

| Don't | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Lead with features | Doesn't resonate | Lead with pain/outcome |
| Use jargon | Confuses buyer | Use their language |
| Talk about "us" | Self-centered | Talk about "you" (the customer) |
| Over-promise | Damages trust | Promise what you can deliver |
| Assume pain | Misses the mark | Discover their specific pain |
