Questions:
1. "What was happening in your business when you started looking for a solution?"
2. "What other solutions did you consider? Why didn't you choose them?"
3. "Who else was involved in the decision? What were their concerns?"
4. "What would have happened if you didn't solve this problem?"
5. "What surprised you most about working with us?"
