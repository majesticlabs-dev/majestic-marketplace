## Churned Customer Interview Script

**For high-value churned customers:**

**Introduction:**
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time. I'm reaching out because your feedback is valuable to us, even though you've moved on. This isn't a sales call—I genuinely want to understand what we could do better."

**Questions:**
1. "What originally brought you to [Product]?"
2. "When did you first start feeling like it might not be the right fit?"
3. "What was the final trigger that made you decide to leave?"
4. "Is there anything specific that would have kept you as a customer?"
5. "What are you using now instead? How is it working?"
6. "If we fixed [issue they mentioned], would you consider coming back?"
7. "What one thing would make this a yes next time?"

**Closing:**
"Thank you so much for your honesty. This is exactly the feedback we need. If anything changes, we'd love to have you back."

**Referral ask (if conversation went well):**
"One last thing—while we weren't the right fit for you, do you know anyone else facing [problem]? I'd be happy to reach out and see if we can help them."
