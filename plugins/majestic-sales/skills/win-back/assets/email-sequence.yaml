      Hey {{first_name}},

      We noticed you haven't [logged in / purchased / used] [Product] in a while.

      We get it—life gets busy, priorities shift. But before you go for good, we wanted to check in:

      Is there something we could have done better?
      Did you find what you needed elsewhere?
      Or did you just get busy?

      [Reply button] — I'd genuinely love to hear what happened.

      No sales pitch, no pressure. Just wanting to understand.

      P.S. If there's anything specific that made you leave, I'll personally make sure the right team hears about it.

      ✨ [New feature/improvement #2] — [brief benefit]
      ✨ [New feature/improvement #3] — [brief benefit]

      We'd hate for you to miss out.

      Hey {{first_name}},

      I'll be direct: we want you back.

      And to make it easier, we're offering you [OFFER]:

      🎁 [Specific offer: e.g., "50% off your next 3 months"]
      🎁 [Additional sweetener if applicable]

      This is only available for [timeframe], and it's only going to people we genuinely want back—like you.

      [CTA: Claim your offer →]

      If cost was a factor before, this might be the nudge you needed.
      If something else was the issue, I'm still here to listen.

    body: |
      Hey {{first_name}},

      This is my last email about coming back to [Product].

      Your [OFFER] expires [DATE/TIME].

      After that, I'll assume you've moved on, and I'll stop reaching out.

      No hard feelings either way—but I didn't want you to miss the chance if you were on the fence.

      [CTA: Use my offer →]

      If this isn't for you right now, that's okay. The door's always open.
