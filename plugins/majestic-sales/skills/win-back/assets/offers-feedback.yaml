    Hi {{first_name}},

    I hope [new solution] is working out for you.

    I know we weren't the right fit, but I wanted to ask: do you know anyone else struggling with [problem we solve]?

    If anyone comes to mind, I'd appreciate an intro. No pressure either way.

    Thanks for your time with us.

    [Your name]

    P.S. If your situation ever changes, the door's always open.
