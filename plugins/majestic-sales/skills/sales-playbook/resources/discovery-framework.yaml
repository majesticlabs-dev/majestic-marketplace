      Thanks for taking the time, {{first_name}}. Before we dive in, I did some homework - saw that {{company}} just [recent news]. Congrats on that.

      Here's what I was thinking for our time today:
      1. Learn about what prompted this conversation
      2. Understand your current process and where you're trying to get to
      3. Share a bit about how we've helped similar companies
      4. Figure out if there's a fit worth exploring further

      Does that work? Anything you'd want to add?

  situation:
    duration: "5-7 min"
    goal: "Understand current state"
    questions:
      - "Walk me through your current process for [area you help with]."
      - "What tools are you using today?"
      - "How many people are involved in this?"
      - "How long have you been doing it this way?"

  problem:

    goal: "Uncover pain and quantify impact"
    questions:
      - "What made you take this meeting today?"
      - "What's the biggest challenge with the current approach?"
      - "How much time does your team spend on [problem area]?"
      - "What does that cost in terms of [revenue/time/morale]?"
      - "How long has this been a problem?"
      - "What have you tried to fix it?"
    dig_deeper:
      - "Tell me more about that."
      - "What do you mean by [term they used]?"
      - "What's the impact of that?"
      - "How does that affect you personally?"

  impact:
    duration: "5-7 min"
    goal: "Connect problem to business outcomes"
    questions:
      - "If you solved this, what would that mean for the business?"
      - "How does this affect your team's ability to [hit goals]?"
      - "What does this problem cost you in terms of [specific metric]?"
      - "If you don't fix this, what happens in 6-12 months?"

  future_state:
    duration: "5 min"
    goal: "Paint the vision"
    questions:
      - "If you had a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?"
      - "What would success look like 6 months from now?"
      - "What would you be able to do that you can't do today?"

  decision_process:
    duration: "5 min"
    goal: "Map the buying journey"
    questions:
      - "Who else would need to be involved in evaluating this?"
      - "What's your typical process for making decisions like this?"
      - "What would need to happen for this to become a priority?"
      - "What's your timeline for making a change?"

  closing:
    duration: "3-5 min"
    goal: "Secure next steps with micro-commitments"
    micro_commitment_questions:
      - "Who else needs to weigh in on this decision?"
      - "What internal approvals are required to move forward?"
      - "What would prevent this from becoming a priority this quarter?"
    script: |
      Based on what you've shared, I think there's a strong fit. Before we wrap up, I want to make sure we're aligned on next steps.

      First, a few quick questions:
      - Who else at {{company}} should be part of this conversation?
      - What's the typical approval process for something like this?
      - What concerns do you anticipate coming up internally?

      [Listen to responses]

      Here's what I'd suggest for next steps:

      [Option A]: I can put together a quick demo showing how we've solved [specific problem] for [similar company]. Would [day/time] work?

      [Option B]: Let me send over a case study from [similar company] - they had the exact same challenge. Then we can reconvene with [other stakeholder] for a demo.

      What makes more sense for you?
