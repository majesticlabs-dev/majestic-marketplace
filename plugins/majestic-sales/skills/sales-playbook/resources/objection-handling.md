# Objection Handling Playbook

## Framework: LAER
- **L**isten - Let them finish, don't interrupt
- **A**cknowledge - Show you heard them
- **E**xplore - Understand the real concern
- **R**espond - Address with specifics

---

## Price Objections

**Investment Framing Principle:**
Frame pricing discussions around ROI, not cost. Key language shift:
- ❌ "The cost is $X"
- ✅ "The investment is $X, which delivers [outcome] in [timeframe]"

---

**"It's too expensive"**

ACKNOWLEDGE: "I hear you - investment size is always a consideration."

EXPLORE: "Help me understand - too expensive compared to what? Your current solution, a competitor, or the budget you had in mind?"

RESPOND:
- If vs. current: "What's the cost of staying with the current approach? You mentioned [pain] costs you [amount]."
- If vs. competitor: "You're right, we're not the cheapest. What [Competitor] doesn't include is [differentiator]. Our customers find that saves them [X]."
- If vs. budget: "Let's look at the return. Based on similar clients, this delivers 5x return in 90 days."

**"We don't have budget"**

EXPLORE: "Is it that budget doesn't exist, or that it hasn't been allocated yet?"

RESPOND:
- If not allocated: "When does your planning cycle start? Let's time this so you can include it."
- If no budget exists: "What would need to happen for this to become a budget priority?"
- **Investment framing:** "Most teams find budget when they see the ROI. Based on your numbers, this investment returns [X]x in [timeframe]."
- Alternative: "We have flexible payment terms - would quarterly payments help?"

---

## Timing Objections

**"Now isn't the right time"**

EXPLORE: "I understand. What would need to change for the timing to be right?"

RESPOND:
- "You mentioned [pain] is costing you [X] per month. Every month you wait, that's [X] you're not getting back."
- "What's happening in [their suggested timeframe] that makes it better?"
- "What if we started with a smaller scope to reduce the lift?"

---

**"We're too busy right now"**

EXPLORE: "Makes sense - you're dealing with [current priority]. How long do you expect that to last?"

RESPOND:
- "What if [Product] actually reduced the workload on [current priority]?"
- "Our implementation is designed for busy teams - most customers are live in [timeframe] with [minimal hours] of their time."

---

## Competitor Objections

**"We're also looking at [Competitor]"**

EXPLORE: "Good - they're a solid option. What's attracting you to them?"

RESPOND:
- "[Competitor] is great at [what they're good at]. Where we differ is [differentiator]."
- "Most customers who evaluate both choose us because [reason]."
- "What criteria are you using to compare?"

---

**"We already use [Competitor]"**

EXPLORE: "How's that working for you? What do you like about it? What's missing?"

RESPOND:
- "I wouldn't suggest ripping that out. But I'm curious - how are you handling [thing competitor doesn't do well]?"
- "We actually integrate with [Competitor]. Many customers use us for [specific use case] alongside them."

---

## Authority Objections

**"I need to talk to my team/boss"**

EXPLORE: "Of course. What do you think their main concerns will be?"

RESPOND:
- "What can I provide that would help you make the case?"
- "Would it help if I joined that conversation to answer technical questions?"
- "What outcome would make you a hero to your boss?"

---

**"The decision maker isn't interested"**

EXPLORE: "What's their main hesitation?"

RESPOND:
- "What if we focused on [specific benefit for decision maker's priorities]?"
- "I've seen this before. Usually [title] cares about [higher-level metric]. Can I share how [similar company] presented it internally?"

---

## Trust Objections

**"I've never heard of you"**

RESPOND:
- "That's fair - we're more focused on building product than marketing. But we work with [notable customer names]."
- "Here's a case study from [company in their industry]. Happy to connect you with them directly."

---

**"What if you go out of business?"**

RESPOND:
- "Valid concern. We're [funding status/profitable/backed by X]. Here's what that means for product continuity."
- "All your data is exportable at any time. You're never locked in."

---

## Status Quo Objections

**"We'll just build it ourselves"**

EXPLORE: "Tell me about that - what would the timeline look like?"

RESPOND:
- "You could. But engineering time costs [X]. By the time you build and maintain it, you'd spend [Y]. We're [fraction] of that and you get it now."
- "What would your engineers be building instead of this? That's the real cost."

---

**"We're fine with our current process"**

EXPLORE: "What's working well? What's not?"

RESPOND:
- "I hear that a lot, until I ask about [specific pain]. How are you handling that today?"
- "Your competitors are already using [modern approach]. What's your plan to keep up?"
