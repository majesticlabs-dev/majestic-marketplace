# Closing Techniques

## Trial Closes (Throughout the Sales Process)
Use to gauge buying temperature:

- "Does this sound like what you're looking for?"
- "Can you see your team using this?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you this solves your problem?"
- "What would need to be true for you to move forward?"

## Assumptive Close
Act as if the deal is done:

"Great - let me get the paperwork started. For implementation, would you prefer [option A] or [option B]?"

## Summary Close
Recap value and ask for the business:

"So we've established that [Product] will:
1. Save your team [X hours] per week
2. Reduce [problem metric] by [Y%]
3. Give you [capability] you don't have today

The investment is [price]. When would you like to get started?"

## Urgency Close (Use Sparingly)
Create legitimate time pressure:

- "Our implementation team has availability starting [date]. After that, the next slot is [later date]."
- "This pricing is locked until [date]. After that, it increases to [new price]."
- "We can include [bonus] if we close by end of [period]."

## Walk-Away Close
For stuck deals:

"I get the sense the timing isn't right. I don't want to keep pushing if this isn't a priority. Should we reconnect in [timeframe], or is there something specific holding you back?"

## Split Decision Close
When they can't decide:

"It sounds like you're torn between [concern A] and [concern B]. Let me ask - if [concern A] wasn't an issue, would you move forward? Okay, let's solve that specifically."

## Puppy Dog Close
Let them try before buying:

"What if you tried [Product] for [period] with your actual data? That way, you can prove the value to yourself before making a commitment."

## Shadow Selling

Arm champions to sell internally when you can't be in the room:

**Setup:** "[Champion], I want to make sure you're set up to succeed presenting this internally. Can I share talking points that worked for other champions?"

**Provide:** ROI calculator, one-pager, comparison chart, reference contacts, FAQ doc.

**Follow-up:** "How did it go? What questions came up?"
