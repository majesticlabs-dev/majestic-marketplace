# Demo Framework

## Pre-Demo Prep
- [ ] Review discovery notes
- [ ] Customize demo environment for their use case
- [ ] Prepare 2-3 "aha moment" features relevant to their pain
- [ ] Have case study ready for similar company
- [ ] Confirm attendees and their roles

## Demo Agenda (45-60 min)

### Opening Recap (5 min)
"Before I show you anything, let me make sure I understood our last conversation correctly. You mentioned:

1. [Pain point 1] is costing you [impact]
2. [Pain point 2] is creating [problem]
3. You need a solution that [key requirement]

Did I get that right? Anything change since we talked?"

### Demo Flow (25-30 min)

Structure: Problem → Solution → Proof

For each key capability:

```
PROBLEM: "You mentioned [specific pain from discovery]..."
SOLUTION: "Here's how [Product] handles that..." [Show feature]
PROOF: "When [similar company] implemented this, they saw [result]..."
CHECK: "How would this work in your environment?"
```

**Demo Sequence:**
1. **Quick Win** - Show easiest value (2-3 min)
2. **Core Pain #1** - Address biggest problem (8-10 min)
3. **Core Pain #2** - Address second problem (8-10 min)
4. **Differentiator** - What competitors can't do (5 min)

**Engagement Points:**
- "Can you see your team using this?"
- "How does this compare to what you're doing today?"
- "What questions does this raise?"
- "Who on your team would use this most?"

## Handling Demo Objections

**"Can you show me X feature?"**
- If relevant: "Absolutely - let me show you that now."
- If not relevant: "I can show you that, but I want to make sure we cover [more important thing] first. Let me note that and we'll come back to it."

**"Our use case is different..."**
- "Tell me more about what makes it different."
- "We've seen that before - let me show you how [similar customer] handled it."

**"That looks complicated..."**
- "Fair point. Let me show you what day-one actually looks like."
- "Our customers usually get to [first value] within [timeframe]."

## Closing the Demo (10-15 min)

**Summary:**
"Let me recap what we covered:
- [Capability 1] addresses your [pain 1]
- [Capability 2] solves your [pain 2]
- [Differentiator] is something you can't get with [competitor]

**Questions:**
- "What stood out most to you?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you this solves your problem?"
- "What questions do you have for me?"
- "What would prevent this from moving forward?"

**Next Steps:**
"Based on this, here's what I'd recommend:
1. I'll send you a proposal with pricing options
2. We schedule a call with [other stakeholder] to answer their questions
3. We target [date] for a decision

Does that timeline work?"
