# Demo Framework

pre_demo_prep:
  checklist:
    - "Review discovery notes"
    - "Customize demo environment for their use case"
    - "Prepare 2-3 'aha moment' features relevant to their pain"
    - "Have case study ready for similar company"
    - "Confirm attendees and their roles"

demo_agenda:
  duration: "45-60 min"

  opening:
    duration: "5 min"

      Before I show you anything, let me make sure I understood our last conversation correctly. You mentioned:

      1. [Pain point 1] is costing you [impact]
      2. [Pain point 2] is creating [problem]
      3. You need a solution that [key requirement]

      Did I get that right? Anything change since we talked?

  demo_flow:
    duration: "25-30 min"
    structure: "Problem → Solution → Proof"
    per_capability:
      problem: "You mentioned [specific pain from discovery]..."
      solution: "Here's how [Product] handles that... [Show feature]"
      proof: "When [similar company] implemented this, they saw [result]..."
      check: "How would this work in your environment?"

    sequence:
      - name: "Quick Win"
        purpose: "Show easiest value"
        duration: "2-3 min"
      - name: "Core Pain #1"
        purpose: "Address biggest problem"
        duration: "8-10 min"
      - name: "Core Pain #2"
        purpose: "Address second problem"
        duration: "8-10 min"
      - name: "Differentiator"
        purpose: "What competitors can't do"
        duration: "5 min"

    engagement_points:
      - "Can you see your team using this?"
      - "How does this compare to what you're doing today?"
      - "What questions does this raise?"
      - "Who on your team would use this most?"

  closing:
    duration: "10-15 min"

demo_objection_handling:
  feature_request:
    objection: "Can you show me X feature?"
    responses:
      - if_relevant: "Absolutely - let me show you that now."
      - if_not_relevant: "I can show you that, but I want to make sure we cover [more important thing] first. Let me note that and we'll come back to it."

  different_use_case:
    objection: "Our use case is different..."
    responses:
      - "Tell me more about what makes it different."
      - "We've seen that before - let me show you how [similar customer] handled it."

  looks_complicated:
    objection: "That looks complicated..."
    responses:
      - "Fair point. Let me show you what day-one actually looks like."
      - "Our customers usually get to [first value] within [timeframe]."

closing_the_demo:
  summary_template: |
    Let me recap what we covered:
    - [Capability 1] addresses your [pain 1]
    - [Capability 2] solves your [pain 2]
    - [Differentiator] is something you can't get with [competitor]

  questions:
    - "What stood out most to you?"
    - "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you this solves your problem?"
    - "What questions do you have for me?"
    - "What would prevent this from moving forward?"

  next_steps_template: |
    Based on this, here's what I'd recommend:
    1. I'll send you a proposal with pricing options
    2. We schedule a call with [other stakeholder] to answer their questions
    3. We target [date] for a decision

    Does that timeline work?
