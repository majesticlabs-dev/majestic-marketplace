## Pre-Call Prep (5 min)

## Opening (3-5 min)
**Goal:** Build rapport, set agenda

**Script:**
"Thanks for taking the time, {{first_name}}. Before we dive in, I did some homework - saw that {{company}} just [recent news]. Congrats on that.

Here's what I was thinking for our time today:
1. Learn about what prompted this conversation
2. Understand your current process and where you're trying to get to
3. Share a bit about how we've helped similar companies
4. Figure out if there's a fit worth exploring further

Does that work? Anything you'd want to add?"

## Situation (5-7 min)
**Goal:** Understand current state

**Questions:**
- "Walk me through your current process for [area you help with]."
- "What tools are you using today?"
- "How many people are involved in this?"
- "How long have you been doing it this way?"

## Problem (10-15 min)
**Goal:** Uncover pain and quantify impact

**Questions:**
- "What made you take this meeting today?"
- "What's the biggest challenge with the current approach?"
- "How much time does your team spend on [problem area]?"
- "What does that cost in terms of [revenue/time/morale]?"
- "How long has this been a problem?"
- "What have you tried to fix it?"

**Dig deeper:**
- "Tell me more about that."
- "What do you mean by [term they used]?"
- "What's the impact of that?"
- "How does that affect you personally?"

## Impact (5-7 min)
**Goal:** Connect problem to business outcomes

**Questions:**
- "If you solved this, what would that mean for the business?"
- "How does this affect your team's ability to [hit goals]?"
- "What does this problem cost you in terms of [specific metric]?"
- "If you don't fix this, what happens in 6-12 months?"

## Future State (5 min)
**Goal:** Paint the vision

**Questions:**
- "If you had a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?"
- "What would success look like 6 months from now?"
- "What would you be able to do that you can't do today?"

## Decision Process (5 min)
**Goal:** Map the buying journey

**Questions:**
- "Who else would need to be involved in evaluating this?"
- "What's your typical process for making decisions like this?"
- "What would need to happen for this to become a priority?"
- "What's your timeline for making a change?"

## Closing (3-5 min)
**Goal:** Secure next steps with micro-commitments

**Micro-Commitment Questions:**
- "Who else needs to weigh in on this decision?"
- "What internal approvals are required to move forward?"
- "What would prevent this from becoming a priority this quarter?"

**Script:**
"Based on what you've shared, I think there's a strong fit. Before we wrap up, I want to make sure we're aligned on next steps.

First, a few quick questions:
- Who else at {{company}} should be part of this conversation?
- What's the typical approval process for something like this?
- What concerns do you anticipate coming up internally?

[Listen to responses]

Here's what I'd suggest for next steps:

[Option A]: I can put together a quick demo showing how we've solved [specific problem] for [similar company]. Would [day/time] work?

[Option B]: Let me send over a case study from [similar company] - they had the exact same challenge. Then we can reconvene with [other stakeholder] for a demo.

What makes more sense for you?"
