# Closing Techniques

trial_closes:
  purpose: "Gauge buying temperature throughout the sales process"
  examples:
    - "Does this sound like what you're looking for?"
    - "Can you see your team using this?"
    - "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you this solves your problem?"
    - "What would need to be true for you to move forward?"

assumptive:
  description: "Act as if the deal is done"
  example: "Great - let me get the paperwork started. For implementation, would you prefer [option A] or [option B]?"

summary:
  description: "Recap value and ask for the business"
  template: |
    So we've established that [Product] will:
    1. Save your team [X hours] per week
    2. Reduce [problem metric] by [Y%]
    3. Give you [capability] you don't have today

    The investment is [price]. When would you like to get started?

urgency:
  note: "Use sparingly - create legitimate time pressure"
  examples:
    - "Our implementation team has availability starting [date]. After that, the next slot is [later date]."
    - "This pricing is locked until [date]. After that, it increases to [new price]."
    - "We can include [bonus] if we close by end of [period]."

walk_away:
  purpose: "For stuck deals"
  script: "I get the sense the timing isn't right. I don't want to keep pushing if this isn't a priority. Should we reconnect in [timeframe], or is there something specific holding you back?"

split_decision:
  purpose: "When they can't decide"
  script: "It sounds like you're torn between [concern A] and [concern B]. Let me ask - if [concern A] wasn't an issue, would you move forward? Okay, let's solve that specifically."

puppy_dog:
  description: "Let them try before buying"
  script: "What if you tried [Product] for [period] with your actual data? That way, you can prove the value to yourself before making a commitment."

shadow_selling:
  purpose: "Arm champions to sell internally when you can't be in the room"
  setup: "[Champion], I want to make sure you're set up to succeed presenting this internally. Can I share talking points that worked for other champions?"
  provide:
    - "ROI calculator"
    - "One-pager"
    - "Comparison chart"
    - "Reference contacts"
    - "FAQ doc"
  follow_up: "How did it go? What questions came up?"
  reference: "Full internal pitch framework in follow-up-templates.yaml"
