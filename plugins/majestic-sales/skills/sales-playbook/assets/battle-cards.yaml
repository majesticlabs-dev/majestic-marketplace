# Competitive Battle Cards

gap_analysis_framework:
  discovery_question: "What's one thing your current provider falls short on?"

  follow_up:
    - step: 1
      action: "Quantify the impact"
      prompt: "How much is that costing you in [time/money/opportunity]?"
    - step: 2
      action: "Position your strength"
      prompt: "That's exactly what we built [Product] to solve. Let me show you how we handle [their gap]."
    - step: 3
      action: "Summarize with 3-bullet competitive edge"

        Here's how we're different from [Competitor]:
        - **[Gap they mentioned]:** We [your approach] vs. their [their limitation]
        - **[Additional differentiator 1]:** [Specific capability]
        - **[Additional differentiator 2]:** [Specific capability]

  example:
    discovery: "What's one thing your current provider falls short on?"
    prospect_response: "Their reporting is really limited. We can't customize dashboards."
    follow_up: "How much time does your team spend manually creating reports each week?"
    prospect_answer: "Probably 10 hours across the team."
    close: |
      That's exactly why we built our reporting engine. Here's how we're different from [Competitor]:
      - **Custom dashboards:** Drag-and-drop builder vs. their fixed templates
      - **Real-time data:** Live updates vs. their 24-hour lag
      - **Export flexibility:** Any format vs. CSV only

      That 10 hours goes back to your team immediately.
