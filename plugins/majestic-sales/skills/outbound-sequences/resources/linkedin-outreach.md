# LinkedIn Outreach

## Connection Request (300 char max, no pitch)

```
{{first_name}}, I came across your {{post/profile/company}} and noticed {{specific_observation}}.

I work with {{similar_role/company_type}} on {{relevant_topic}}.

Would love to connect and learn more about {{their_focus_area}}.

{{your_name}}
```

## First Message After Connect

```
Thanks for connecting, {{first_name}}.

I noticed {{company}} is focused on {{initiative_from_research}}.

We've been helping {{similar_companies}} with {{related_challenge}} and thought you might find {{specific_resource}} useful.

Happy to share if interested.
```

## Direct Message (Clear Ask)

```
{{first_name}},

I've been following {{company}}'s work on {{initiative}} - impressive results.

We helped {{similar_company}} achieve {{specific_result}} with a similar challenge.

Would a 15-minute call to share what worked for them be useful?

Either way, keep up the great work.
```
