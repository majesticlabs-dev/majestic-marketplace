      Great - here's my calendar: [link]

      Appreciate the response, {{first_name}}.

      Quick question - is there someone else at {{company}} who handles [area]? Or would it make sense to reconnect in Q[X] when budgets reset?

      Either way, thanks for letting me know.

      Makes sense - [Competitor] is solid for [what they do well].

      Most folks I talk to who switch were looking for [your differentiator]. Not saying that's you, but if you ever want to see the difference, happy to do a quick comparison.

      Worth 15 minutes?

      I'll set a reminder and reach back out then. In the meantime, I'll send occasional updates if we publish anything relevant to [their industry].

      Sound good?
