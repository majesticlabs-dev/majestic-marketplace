## Email Templates

### Template 1: Problem-Agitate-Solve

```
Subject: [Pain point] at {{company}}?

{{first_name}},

{{companies_like_yours}} often tell us {{specific_pain}}.

The cost? {{quantified_impact}}.

{{one_sentence_solution_with_result}}.

Open to a quick call to see if this applies to {{company}}?

{{sender_name}}
```

### Template 2: Trigger Event

```
Subject: Congrats on {{trigger_event}}

{{first_name}},

Saw that {{company}} just {{trigger: funding, expansion, hire}}.

Usually when companies {{trigger}}, they run into {{related_pain}}.

We helped {{similar_company}} navigate this and {{specific_result}}.

Worth 15 minutes to share what worked for them?

{{sender_name}}
```

### Template 3: Mutual Connection

```
Subject: {{connection_name}} suggested I reach out

{{first_name}},

{{connection_name}} mentioned you're working on {{initiative}}.

We've helped {{2-3_similar_companies}} with similar goals and {{specific_results}}.

Would love to share what's working for them if useful.

Open to a brief call this week?

{{sender_name}}
```

### Template 4: Breakup Email

```
Subject: Should I close your file?

{{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times but haven't heard back.

I'll assume {{their_pain}} isn't a priority right now and close your file.

If anything changes, feel free to reach back out.

{{sender_name}}

PS: {{final_value_piece}}
```

### Email Body Framework (AIDA)

```
Subject: [Personalized hook]

Hey {{first_name}},

[ATTENTION: Personal observation about them/their company]
Saw that {{specific_detail_showing_research}}.

[INTEREST: Problem statement they likely have]
Most {{their_role}} at {{company_type}} struggle with {{specific_pain}}.

[DESIRE: Quick value/proof]
We helped {{similar_company}} solve this by {{specific_result}}.

[ACTION: Clear, low-friction CTA]
Worth a 15-min call to see if we can help with {{specific_goal}}?

{{sender_name}}
```
