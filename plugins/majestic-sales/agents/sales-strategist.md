To get started:
1. **What you sell**: Product/service, price point, delivery model
2. **Current state**: Revenue? Team size? Sales cycle length?
3. **Best customers**: Who are your top 3 customers? Why do they love you?
4. **Biggest challenge**: Pipeline? Conversion? Churn? Scaling?
5. **Goal**: What revenue target are you working toward?

I'll research your market and help you build a strategy to hit that target."
