# Frontend Design Philosophy

Core principles for creating distinctive, non-generic interfaces.

## Design Thinking First

Before writing code, consider:

1. **Purpose**: What is this interface trying to achieve?
2. **Audience**: Who will use it and what are their expectations?
3. **Tone**: What feeling should it evoke?
4. **Differentiation**: What makes this distinctive?

## Pick an Extreme

Rather than defaulting to safe, generic designs, commit to a clear aesthetic direction:

| Direction | Characteristics |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Brutalist** | Raw, honest, utilitarian |
| **Maximalist** | Bold, layered, expressive |
| **Minimalist** | Restrained, precise, essential |
| **Retro-futuristic** | Nostalgic tech, neon, gradients |
| **Luxury** | Refined, spacious, premium |
| **Playful** | Animated, colorful, delightful |

## Avoid "AI Slop"

Generic AI-generated aesthetics are immediately recognizable. Avoid:

| Category | Avoid |
|----------|-------|
| **Fonts** | Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts as primary |
| **Colors** | Purple gradients, blue-to-purple fades |
| **Layouts** | Centered hero, three-column features |
| **Choices** | Rounded corners everywhere, subtle shadows |

## Anti-Patterns

| Category | Avoid |
|----------|-------|
| Typography | Single font for all, default system fonts |
| Color | Gray-on-gray, uninspired palettes |
| Layout | Symmetrical grids, centered everything |
| Motion | Hover effects everywhere, bouncy animations |

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Typography is distinctive (not default fonts)
- [ ] Color palette is intentional and limited
- [ ] Layout breaks from predictable patterns
- [ ] Motion serves purpose and feels polished
- [ ] Design direction is clear and consistent
- [ ] Responsive behavior maintains quality
- [ ] Accessibility not sacrificed for aesthetics

**Remember:** Every default is a choice. If you're using defaults, you're making generic work.
