**Audience:** Developers with PR review comments that need resolution.

**Goal:** Understand reviewer feedback, implement changes, verify fixes.

## PR Comment Commands

```bash
# List all PR comments
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --comments

# Get review comments on files
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments

# Get specific review details
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/reviews
```

## Comment Types

| Type | Indicators | Action |
|------|------------|--------|
| Bug fix | "This will break...", "Missing check..." | Implement the fix |
| Refactor | "Extract this...", "This is too complex..." | Apply the pattern |
| Style | "Rename to...", "Format as..." | Adjust naming/format |
| Tests | "Add test for...", "Missing coverage..." | Add test cases |
| Docs | "Add comment...", "Document this..." | Add documentation |
| Questions | "Why...?", "What about...?" | Reply with explanation |

## Workflow

1. **Read** - Get comment content and context
2. **Locate** - Find the code being discussed
3. **Understand** - Note constraints/preferences
4. **Implement** - Make requested changes
5. **Verify** - Run tests if code changed
6. **Report** - Summarize resolution

## Implementation Principles

- Address the specific feedback
- Maintain existing code style
- Don't break other functionality
- Follow project conventions
- Ask if feedback is ambiguous
