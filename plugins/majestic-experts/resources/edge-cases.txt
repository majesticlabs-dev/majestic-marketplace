# Expert Panel Discussion Edge Cases

Reference for handling special situations during panel orchestration.

## Expert Count Variations

### 2 Experts (Minimum for Debate)
- Still valid for debate format
- Consensus requires 100% agreement (2/2)
- Best for direct opposition discussions

### 5 Experts (Maximum Recommended)
- More diverse perspectives
- Harder to reach consensus
- Focus on clustering similar views
- Consider grouping related positions

### Uneven Debate Camps
- If 3 experts in debate, assign 2 to one side, 1 to the other
- Acknowledge the numerical imbalance in synthesis
- Weight arguments by quality, not quantity

## Discussion Type Edge Cases

### Debate with Unexpected Consensus
- If debate reaches consensus in Round 1, acknowledge and conclude
- Document "Debate resolved - experts agree"
- Explore nuances even within agreement

### Consensus-seeking with Impasse
- If Round 3 shows hardened positions with no progress, conclude
- Document as "Productive impasse - fundamental philosophical differences"
- Clearly explain both positions and why they're irreconcilable
- This is a valid outcome - not a failure

### Deep-dive with Early Consensus
- Still run all 3 rounds (by design)
- Round 2: Explore nuances and edge cases
- Round 3: Long-term implications and second-order effects

## Sequential Thinking Usage

### When to Use
- After each round to analyze responses and decide next steps
- For complex synthesis where consensus/divergence isn't obvious
- When synthesizing 4+ expert responses
- When discussion type rules have edge cases

### When NOT to Use
- Simple consensus checks (e.g., all 3 experts clearly agree)
- Counting agreement percentages (manual counting suffices)
- Obvious continue/conclude decisions

### Cost Management
- Sequential thinking adds cost but ensures quality analysis
- Use thoughtfully, not automatically for every decision
- Skip for straightforward unanimous agreement

## Context Growth Management

| Round | Context Size | Strategy |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Round 1 | Topic + Background | Full context |
| Round 2 | Round 1 + Expert responses | Summarize R1 key points |
| Round 3 | Round 1 + Round 2 + responses | Compress to themes |

**Keep summaries concise between rounds to manage context size.**

## Example Flows

### Round-table (1 round)
```
Round 1: Launch 3 experts → Analyze → Synthesize → Done
```

### Debate (2-3 rounds)
```
Round 1: Thesis → Analyze → Continue
Round 2: Antithesis → Analyze → Check synthesis
  If complete → Synthesize → Done
  If not → Continue
Round 3: Synthesis → Analyze → Synthesize → Done
```

### Consensus-seeking (1-3 rounds)
```
Round 1: Initial positions → Analyze → Check agreement
  If >80% → Synthesize → Done
  If not → Continue
Round 2: Refinement → Analyze → Check agreement
  If >80% or impasse → Synthesize → Done
  If not → Continue
Round 3: Final attempt → Analyze → Synthesize → Done
  (document consensus OR productive impasse)
```

### Deep-dive (exactly 3 rounds)
```
Round 1: Surface analysis → Analyze → Continue
Round 2: Deeper exploration → Analyze → Continue
Round 3: Nuanced insights → Analyze → Synthesize → Done
```

### Devil's-advocate (exactly 2 rounds)
```
Round 1: Initial positions → Analyze → Identify consensus/majority view
Round 2: Challenge round (ALL experts argue AGAINST the consensus) → Analyze
  → Synthesize with enhanced critical evaluation
```

**Devil's Advocate Special Rules:**
- Round 2 instruction: "Now argue AGAINST the position you just took. What are the strongest counter-arguments? What assumptions might be wrong? How could this fail?"
- Every expert must challenge their own Round 1 position
- Synthesis emphasizes failure modes and blind spots over recommendations
- Use when: user wants stress-testing, you suspect groupthink, or question has high stakes
