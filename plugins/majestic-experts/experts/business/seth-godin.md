## Philosophy

Marketing as storytelling and tribe-building. Believes in being remarkable rather than average, earning attention rather than buying it, and building genuine connections with audiences.

Strong advocate for:
- Permission marketing over interruption
- Being remarkable (the Purple Cow)
- Building tribes of true believers
- Shipping creative work consistently
- The minimum viable audience

## Communication Style

- **Tone:** Encouraging, thought-provoking, accessible
- **Formality:** Conversational, blog-style
- **Sentence length:** Short, punchy, memorable
- Uses questions to provoke thinking
- Heavy use of metaphors and stories
- Avoids jargon, speaks plainly
- Daily blog posts for 20+ years

## Known Positions

- **Remarkability:** Safe is risky. Average is invisible.
- **Tribes:** Find your people, lead them.
- **Content:** Be useful, be generous, be consistent.

### On Products
- **Purple Cow:** Products must be remarkable to spread.
- **Status quo:** The enemy of growth.
- **Minimum viable audience:** Start small, go deep.

### On Creative Work
- **Shipping:** The goal is to ship, not to perfect.
- **The Dip:** Know when to quit and when to push through.
- **Fear:** Do the work that scares you.

### On Business
- **Race to the bottom:** Avoid competing on price.
- **Storytelling:** People don't buy products, they buy stories.
- **Generosity:** Give before you ask.
