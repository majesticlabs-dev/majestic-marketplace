## Assumption Risk Framework

### High Risk (Validate First)

| Assumption | Validation Method | Success Criteria |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| Problem exists | Customer interviews (10+) | 7/10 confirm problem |
| Willing to pay | Price testing, pre-orders | 3+ paying commitments |
| Pain is acute | Severity scoring | Average 8+/10 |

### Medium Risk (Validate During MVP)

| Assumption | Validation Method | Success Criteria |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| Features priority | Usage analytics | 60%+ use core feature |
| Channel works | A/B testing | CAC < 1/3 LTV |
| Positioning | Competitive testing | Clear preference signals |

### Low Risk (Validate Post-Launch)

- Scale assumptions
- Expansion opportunities
- Adjacent markets

## MVP Strategy

### Definition Criteria

| Element | Question | Output |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Core value | What's the one thing it MUST do? | Single feature |
| Target user | Who has this problem most acutely? | Narrow persona |
| Success metric | How do we know it works? | Measurable KPI |
| Timeline | What's the fastest we can test? | Weeks, not months |

### Feature Prioritization

| Category | Include in MVP | Defer |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Must-have | Core value delivery | Enhancement features |
| Differentiator | Key unique angle | Secondary differentiators |
| Table stakes | Minimum viable | Nice-to-haves |

## Validation Methodology

### Customer Discovery Script

**Opening (2 min)**
- Build rapport
- Explain purpose: learning, not selling

**Problem Exploration (10 min)**
- "Tell me about the last time you dealt with [problem]..."
- "What did you try? What worked/didn't work?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how painful is this?"

**Solution Testing (5 min)**
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would happen?"
- "I'm working on something that [brief description]..."
- "Would this help? Why or why not?"

**Commitment Testing (3 min)**
- "Would you be interested in trying an early version?"
- "What would you expect to pay for something like this?"
- "Can I follow up when we have something to show?"

### Signal Interpretation

| Signal | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| "I'd pay for this" | Interest | Get specific on price |
| "Keep me updated" | Lukewarm | Find stronger pain |
| "I already have X" | Competition | Differentiate or pivot |
| "Let me introduce you to..." | Enthusiasm | Strong signal |

## Decision Framework

### Green Light (Proceed)

- 70%+ confirm problem exists
- 3+ paying commitments
- Clear differentiation
- Unit economics work

### Yellow Light (Iterate)

- Mixed feedback on value prop
- Price resistance but interest
- Unclear positioning
- Channel uncertainty

### Red Light (Pivot)

- <30% problem confirmation
- No willingness to pay
- Existing solutions "good enough"
- No user enthusiasm

## PMF Indicators

| Metric | Pre-PMF | At PMF | Strong PMF |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| Retention | <20% | 40%+ | 60%+ |
| NPS | <20 | 40+ | 60+ |
| Word of mouth | <10% | 25%+ | 40%+ |
| Revenue growth | Flat | 20%+ MoM | 50%+ MoM |
| Inbound demand | None | Some | Pull > Push |
