# Scoring Rubrics Reference

Detailed scoring criteria for the Problem Research skill.

---

## Pain Point Score (PPS)

### Formula

```
PPS = Frequency Score × Severity Score × Recency Multiplier
```

**Score Range: 0.5 to 30**

### Frequency Score (1-5)

| Score | Mentions | Interpretation | Evidence Pattern |
|-------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | 1-2 | Isolated complaint | Single user, edge case |
| 2 | 3-5 | Notable pattern | Multiple users, similar language |
| 3 | 6-10 | Common issue | Appears across platforms |
| 4 | 11-20 | Widespread problem | Dominant theme in reviews |
| 5 | 20+ | Systemic failure | Universal complaint, defines perception |

### Severity Score (1-4)

| Score | Level | Definition | Signal Words | User Behavior |
|-------|-------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | Annoyance | Minor inconvenience, easy workarounds | "wish," "minor," "sometimes," "would be nice" | Continues using, minor grumbles |
| 2 | Friction | Slows workflow, noticeable impact | "frustrating," "annoying," "confusing," "clunky" | Works around, complains regularly |
| 3 | Blocker | Prevents specific use cases | "can't," "impossible," "forced to," "no way to" | Stops using feature, seeks alternatives |
| 4 | Dealbreaker | Causes churn, active switching | "leaving," "nightmare," "unacceptable," "deal-breaker" | Actively switching, warns others |

### Recency Multiplier

| Multiplier | Timeframe | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 0.5 | >2 years old only | Possibly fixed, may be stale |
| 0.75 | 1-2 years old | Likely outdated |
| 1.0 | Mixed recency | Standard weight |
| 1.25 | Mostly <1 year | Current issue |
| 1.5 | Mostly <6 months | Active, ongoing problem |

### PPS Interpretation

| Score Range | Priority | Market Implication | Action |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| 20-30 | Critical | Solve this, win the market | Primary differentiator |
| 10-19 | High | Strong wedge opportunity | Core feature priority |
| 5-9 | Medium | Worth considering | Secondary feature |
| <5 | Low | Nice-to-have territory | Deprioritize |

## Hidden Gem Score

### Formula

```
Hidden Gem Score = Pain Frequency × Competitor Gap Score
```

### Competitor Gap Score (0-5)

| Score | Competitor Coverage | Opportunity Level |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 0 | All major competitors have it | No opportunity |
| 1 | Most competitors (80%+) have it | Minimal opportunity |
| 2 | Half of competitors have it | Some opportunity |
| 3 | Few competitors (20-40%) address it | Good opportunity |
| 4 | Only minor players address it | Strong opportunity |
| 5 | No competitor addresses it | Blue ocean opportunity |

### Hidden Gem Qualification Criteria

**Must meet ALL of these:**
- Mentioned by 3+ users across different reviews
- High emotional intensity when mentioned (severity 3-4)
- Not adequately addressed by major competitors (gap score 3+)
- Specific and actionable (not vague wishes)

**Does NOT qualify as hidden gem:**
- Already being addressed by a competitor
- Too niche (<3 mentions)
- Technical limitation rather than product decision
- Vague feature requests ("make it better")

## Viability Scorecard

### Scoring Criteria (1-5 per factor)

#### Market Pain Severity

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Mild annoyances, "nice to have" improvements |
| 2 | Noticeable friction, workarounds common |
| 3 | Regular frustration, some users switching |
| 4 | Severe pain, active migration discussions |
| 5 | Crisis-level, mass exodus, lawsuit threats |

**Evidence to look for:**
- Emotional language intensity
- Switching behavior mentions
- Workaround complexity
- Time/money lost descriptions

#### Willingness to Pay

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Users want free/cheap solutions |
| 2 | Price-sensitive, compare extensively |
| 3 | Willing to pay for quality |
| 4 | "Worth any price" for right solution |
| 5 | Currently overpaying, money ready |

**Evidence to look for:**
- Price complaint patterns (counterintuitively positive)
- "Would pay more for X" comments
- Budget mentions
- ROI discussions

#### Competitor Vulnerability

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Strong, innovating, responsive competitors |
| 2 | Stable competitors, moderate innovation |
| 3 | Complacent competitors, ignored complaints |
| 4 | Acquisition news, stale products, layoffs |
| 5 | Competitors in crisis, actively failing users |

**Evidence to look for:**
- Response patterns to complaints
- Product update frequency
- Company news (acquisitions, layoffs)
- User sentiment trends over time

#### Switching Cost Reality

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Deep integration, years of data, high lock-in |
| 2 | Significant but manageable migration effort |
| 3 | Moderate switching costs, some portability |
| 4 | Low switching costs, easy data export |
| 5 | Users actively planning migration, low barriers |

**Evidence to look for:**
- Data portability mentions
- "Stuck with" language
- Migration success stories
- Integration depth complaints

#### Market Timing

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Stable market, no recent changes |
| 2 | Minor market shifts |
| 3 | Moderate changes creating opportunities |
| 4 | Recent disruption (pricing, features, acquisition) |
| 5 | Perfect storm (major competitor failure, new regulation, tech shift) |

**Evidence to look for:**
- Recent pricing changes
- Feature removals
- Regulatory changes
- Technology platform shifts
- Major competitor news

#### Differentiation Potential

| Score | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Commodity market, need full feature parity |
| 2 | Minor differentiation possible |
| 3 | Clear differentiation angle available |
| 4 | Can solve 1 thing 10x better |
| 5 | Unique approach possible, paradigm shift |

**Evidence to look for:**
- Unaddressed pain concentration
- Technical feasibility of better solution
- Market segment specialization opportunity
- New technology enablers

### Viability Score Interpretation

| Total | Verdict | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| 25-30 | **GO** | Strong opportunity, proceed with confidence |
| 18-24 | **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** | Validate further, address specific risks |
| 12-17 | **RECONSIDER** | Significant risks, consider pivoting focus |
| 6-11 | **NO-GO** | Do not pursue without fundamental changes |
