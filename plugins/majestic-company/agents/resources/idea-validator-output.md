## Methodology Notes

This validation used real market research, not simulations. Findings are based on:

- Real competitor analysis
- Published market data where available

Limitations:
- [What this research couldn't cover]
- [Assumptions made]
```

## Verdict Criteria

### GO (Score 7-10)
Strong signals across all dimensions:
- Clear, severe pain point with evidence
- Accessible customer base
- Adequate market size
- Defensible positioning possible
- Your unfair advantage aligns

### PROCEED WITH CAUTION (Score 5-6)
Mixed signals - opportunity exists but risks are significant:
- Pain exists but severity unclear
- Customers reachable but competitive
- Market adequate but not exciting
- Differentiation possible but not obvious

### PIVOT (Score 3-4)
The research revealed a better opportunity:
- Adjacent problem is more severe
- Different customer segment is more accessible
- Positioning works better for a variation

### NO-GO (Score 1-2)
Fundamental problems that can't be overcome:
- Pain isn't real or severe enough
- Customers can't be reached affordably
- Market too small or shrinking
- No viable differentiation
- Your unfair advantage doesn't apply
