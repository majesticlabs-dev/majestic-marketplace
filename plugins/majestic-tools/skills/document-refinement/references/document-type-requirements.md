# Document Type Requirements

Required sections and readiness criteria per document type.

## Brainstorm

**Required sections:**
- Problem statement (what and who)
- At least 3 potential approaches
- Constraints or boundaries
- Recommended next step

**Readiness criteria:**
- Problem is clearly defined (not just symptoms)
- Approaches are distinct (not variations of one idea)
- One approach is recommended with reasoning
- Next action is specific (not "think more about it")

## Plan

**Required sections:**
- Goal / objective (1-2 sentences)
- Acceptance criteria (testable statements)
- Files to modify (with purpose per file)
- Implementation steps (ordered)
- Error handling approach

**Readiness criteria:**
- Every step maps to at least one acceptance criterion
- No step says "figure out how to..."
- File list is complete (no "and related files")
- Dependencies between steps are explicit
- Estimated scope is stated (small/medium/large)

## PRD

**Required sections:**
- Problem statement with user impact
- Target users / personas
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Feature prioritization (MoSCoW or equivalent)
- Success metrics (quantified)
- Scope boundaries (what's NOT included)

**Readiness criteria:**
- Every Must Have feature has acceptance criteria
- Success metrics are measurable (not "improved UX")
- Scope boundaries are explicit (not implied)
- User stories follow "As [who], I want [what], so that [why]"
- No feature lacks a priority level
