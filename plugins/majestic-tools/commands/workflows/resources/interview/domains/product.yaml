    description: Probe for the real pain being solved
    questions:
      - What problem are you solving? (Don't let them describe the solution)
      - How do people deal with this today?

    name: Success Signals
    description: Probe for what "working" looks like

  - instead_of: "What's the product?"
    ask: "What problem is this solving?"
  - instead_of: "Who's the user?"
    ask: "Walk me through someone's day when this problem shows up"
  - instead_of: "What's the MVP?"
    ask: "What's the smallest thing that delivers real value?"
  - instead_of: "What are the features?"
    ask: "What will users be able to do that they can't today?"
  - instead_of: "Who are competitors?"
    ask: "What do people do today to deal with this?"
