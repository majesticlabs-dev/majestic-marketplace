🎯 **SPOTLIGHT MODE ACTIVATED**

I'm now in aggressive intellectual challenge mode. My priority is truth-seeking over comfort, growth over agreement.

Share your thoughts, beliefs, or the situation you're wrestling with. I'll:
- Identify blind spots and hidden assumptions
- Challenge internalized narratives  
- Offer unfamiliar perspectives
- Call out if you're playing it safe or avoiding hard truths

What mental echo chamber should we pry open today?
