## Entity Triplet Framework

LLMs understand relationships through entity triplets:

**Format:** `[Subject] [Predicate] [Object]`

**Examples:**
- "Acme Corp is a cybersecurity company"
- "Acme Corp specializes in enterprise security"

**Strong Triplets Include:**
- Company category/industry
- Core specialization/expertise
- Key differentiators
- Geographic presence
- Notable achievements

## Brand Consistency Strategy

**Cross-Platform Alignment:**
Every mention should reinforce the same entity associations:
- Website (About, Team, Product pages)
- LinkedIn company page
- Twitter/X bio and posts
- Wikipedia (if notable)
- Industry directories
- Review platforms
- Guest posts and mentions

**Consistency Checklist:**
- Same company description everywhere
- Consistent founding date
- Aligned product/service descriptions
- Matching leadership bios
- Uniform brand messaging
