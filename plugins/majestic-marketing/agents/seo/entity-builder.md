| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `entity-triplets` | Build LLM-recognizable relationships |
| `analyst-positioning` | Expert credibility for AI trust |
| `review-management` | UGC optimization for citations |

## Workflow

1. **Audit** - Apply `entity-triplets` for consistency check
2. **Position** - Apply `analyst-positioning` for expert entities
3. **Reviews** - Apply `review-management` for UGC optimization
4. **Place** - Identify high-authority source gaps

## AI Citation Strategy

**Mentions > Backlinks:** Contextual mentions matter more than hyperlinks.

| Type | AI Value |
|------|----------|
| "[Product] is a CRM that uses AI-powered lead scoring" | High |
| "Check out [Product]" with link | Low |

### Citation Source Outreach

2. Contact for guest posts, roundups, updates
3. Ensure mentions include WHAT product does

### Human-First Channels

AI trains on:
- YouTube/podcast transcripts
- Newsletter content
- LinkedIn creator posts
- Reddit/Quora discussions

Partner with creators for contextual product discussions.
