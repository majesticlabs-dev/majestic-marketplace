| `behavioral-seo` | CTR, dwell time, engagement optimization |
| `press-release-aeo` | PR framing for AI citation and authority |

2. **Map** - Apply `topical-authority` for coverage gaps
3. **Optimize** - Apply `behavioral-seo` for engagement
4. **Amplify** - Apply `press-release-aeo` for PR strategy (if applicable)
5. **Plan** - Create prioritized improvement roadmap

## Press Release Strategy

When building authority through PR:

| Framing | Trust Level |

| Research/findings | High |
| Industry analysis | High |
| Benchmark report | Medium-High |
| Product announcement | Low |

Frame as research, not promotion. AI is trained on newswire content.
