## Press Release Strategy for AEO

Press releases create AI-trusted signals when framed correctly. AI is trained on newswire content.

**High-Trust PR Framing:**

| Avoid (Low Trust) | Use Instead (High Trust) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| "Company Launches Best Solution" | "Research Findings Released: [Topic] Analysis" |
| "New Product Available" | "Comparative Study Published: [Category] Evaluation" |
| "Company Wins Award" | "Industry Benchmark Report Reveals [Insight]" |
| "CEO Announces Partnership" | "[Company] Research: [Finding] Across [X] Organizations" |

**Press Release Structure for AI:**

1. **Headline** - Frame as research/findings, not promotion
   - ✅ "[Company] Publishes [Category] Industry Analysis"
   - ❌ "[Company] Launches Revolutionary New Product"

2. **Lead Paragraph** - State findings first, company second
   - ✅ "A new analysis of [X] companies reveals that [finding]. The research, conducted by [Company]..."
   - ❌ "[Company], the leading provider of [X], today announced..."

3. **Body** - Include extractable data
   - Statistics with methodology
   - Comparison tables
   - Expert quotes with credentials
   - Limitations/scope acknowledgment

4. **Boilerplate** - Reinforce entity triplets
   - "[Company] is a [category] research firm specializing in [domain]"

**Distribution for AI Pickup:**

| Channel | AI Training Signal | Cost |
|---------|-------------------|------|
| PR Newswire | High | $$$ |
| Business Wire | High | $$$ |
| GlobeNewswire | Medium-High | $$ |
| PRWeb | Medium | $ |
| Free distribution | Low | Free |

**Speed Factor:** AI indexes fresh newswire content quickly. A well-framed press release can influence AI responses within hours of distribution.

## Behavioral SEO Signals

User behavior signals directly impact rankings, especially on Bing.

### Topical Authority Formula

```
Authority Score = (Topic Coverage %) × (Content Age Factor) × (Behavioral Multiplier)
```

**Topic Coverage %:**
- Map all subtopics in your niche (aim for exhaustive list)
- Count what % you have comprehensive content for
- Target: 60%+ for authority status, 80%+ for dominance

**Content Age Factor:**
- Fresh content: 1.0x
- 3-6 months: 0.9x (unless evergreen)
- 6-12 months: 0.8x
- 12+ months without updates: 0.6x

**Behavioral Multiplier:**
- Based on aggregate user signals (see below)

### Behavioral Metrics to Track

| Metric | Ranking Impact | How to Improve |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Click-through rate (CTR) | High | Optimize titles, meta descriptions, rich snippets |
| Dwell time | High | Match content to search intent, improve readability |
| Bounce rate | Medium | Better content relevance, clear next actions |
| Pages per session | Medium | Strong internal linking, related content |
| Return visits | Medium | Build brand recognition, email capture |
| Social shares | High (Bing) | Create shareable assets, social CTAs |

### Bing-Specific Behavioral SEO

Bing weights behavioral and social signals more heavily than Google:

**Key Bing Differences:**
- Social signals (shares, likes) directly impact rankings
- Fresh content gets faster indexing
- User behavior (CTR, dwell time) has stronger ranking correlation
- Bing rewards exact-match domains more than Google
- Image and video content ranks better

**Bing Optimization Tactics:**
1. Submit sitemap to Bing Webmaster Tools
2. Use IndexNow for instant indexing
3. Integrate social sharing prominently
4. Optimize for Microsoft Edge browser users
5. Consider Bing Places for local SEO

### Competitor Topical Comparison

When analyzing competitor authority:

| Metric | You | Comp A | Comp B | Gap Analysis |
|--------|-----|--------|--------|--------------|
| Total topics covered | | | | |
| Avg content depth (words) | | | | |
| Update frequency | | | | |
| Backlink domains | | | | |
| Social engagement | | | | |
| Author credentials | | | | |

**Finding Competitor Topics:**
1. Crawl their sitemap for content inventory
2. Analyze their top 50 pages by traffic (via Ahrefs/SEMrush)
3. Map their topic clusters and pillar pages
4. Identify topics they rank for that you don't cover

**Platform Implementation:**
- WordPress: Author box plugins, schema
- Static sites: Author components, structured data
- Google Knowledge Panel optimization

Focus on demonstrable expertise and clear trust signals. Suggest concrete improvements for authority building.
