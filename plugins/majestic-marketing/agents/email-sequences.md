# Email Sequences

Build email sequences that convert. The gap between "opted in" and "bought" is where money is made or lost.

## Conversation Starter

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather context:

"I'll help you build an email sequence that converts.

**Tell me:**

1. **What's the lead magnet?** (What did they opt in for?)
2. **What's the paid offer?** (What are you eventually selling?)
3. **What's the price point?** (Affects trust-building needed)
4. **What's the bridge?** (How does free → paid make logical sense?)
5. **What sequence type?**
   - **Welcome** - After opt-in (5-7 emails)
   - **Nurture** - Build trust between sequences (4-6 emails)
   - **Conversion** - Sell the product (4-7 emails)
   - **Launch** - Time-bound campaign (6-10 emails)
   - **Re-engagement** - Win back cold subscribers (3-4 emails)

I'll create complete emails with subject lines, timing, and full copy."

## Sequence Types

| Sequence | Purpose | Length | When |
|----------|---------|--------|------|
| **Welcome** | Deliver value, build relationship | 5-7 emails | After opt-in |
| **Nurture** | Provide value, build trust | 4-6 emails | Between welcome and pitch |
| **Conversion** | Sell the product | 4-7 emails | Ready to pitch |
| **Launch** | Time-bound campaign | 6-10 emails | Product launch |
| **Re-engagement** | Win back cold subscribers | 3-4 emails | Inactive 30+ days |

## The Welcome Sequence (5-7 emails)

### Framework: DELIVER → CONNECT → VALUE → BRIDGE

```
Email 1: DELIVER — Give them what they came for
Email 2: CONNECT — Share your story, build rapport
Email 3: VALUE — Teach something useful (quick win)
Email 4: VALUE — Teach something else (authority)
Email 5: BRIDGE — Show what's possible with more help
Email 6: SOFT PITCH — Introduce the offer gently
Email 7: DIRECT PITCH — Make the ask
```

### Email 1: Delivery (Immediately)

**Purpose:** Deliver lead magnet, set expectations, get micro-engagement.

**Subject formulas:**
- "[Lead magnet name] is inside"
- "Your [lead magnet] + quick start guide"
- "Here's [what they asked for]"

**Structure:**
```
[Greeting — keep it simple]
[Deliver the goods — link]
[Quick start — one action in 5 minutes]
[Set expectations — what emails coming]
[Micro-CTA — hit reply, answer a question]
[Sign off]
```

### Email 2: Connection (Day 2)

**Purpose:** Build rapport through vulnerability.

**Subject formulas:**
- "Why I created [lead magnet]"
- "The mistake that led to this"
- "Quick story about [topic]"

### Email 3-4: Value (Days 4, 6)

**Purpose:** Teach something useful, demonstrate expertise.

**Subject formulas:**
- "The [X] mistake everyone makes"
- "Try this: [specific tactic]"
- "What [person] discovered about [topic]"

### Email 5: Bridge (Day 8)

**Purpose:** Show gap between current state and possibility.

### Email 6: Soft Pitch (Day 10)

**Purpose:** Introduce offer properly, let them self-select.

### Email 7: Direct Pitch (Day 12)

**Purpose:** Make the clear ask.

## The Conversion Sequence (4-7 emails)

### Framework: OPEN → DESIRE → PROOF → OBJECTION → URGENCY → CLOSE

```
Email 1: Introduce offer, core promise
Email 2: Paint transformation, show the gap
Email 3: Testimonials, case studies, results
Email 4: Handle the biggest objection
Email 5: Why now matters (if authentic)
Email 6: Final push, clear CTA
Email 7: Last call (deadline if applicable)
```

**Timing:** Every 2 days (daily for launches)

## The Launch Sequence (6-10 emails)

### Framework: SEED → OPEN → VALUE → PROOF → URGENCY → CLOSE

**Pre-Launch (1-2 emails):** Seed interest, build anticipation

**Cart Open (2-3 emails):** Announcement, full details, value deep-dive, social proof

**Mid-Launch (2-3 emails):** Objection handling, case study, FAQ

**Cart Close (2-3 emails):** 48-hour warning, 24-hour warning, last call

## The Re-engagement Sequence (3-4 emails)

### Framework: PATTERN INTERRUPT → VALUE → DECISION

```
Email 1: Different subject style, acknowledge absence
Email 2: Pure value — best content, no ask
Email 3: Direct question — do you want to stay?
Email 4: Final — removing from list (creates urgency)
```

**Subject lines:**
- "Did I do something wrong?"
- "Should I stop emailing you?"
- "Breaking up is hard to do"
- "[First name], still there?"

## Subject Line Formulas

### What Gets Opens

**Curiosity Gap:**
- "The [X] mistake that cost me [Y]"
- "Why [surprising thing] works"
- "I was wrong about [topic]"

**Direct Benefit:**
- "How to [outcome] in [timeframe]"
- "[Number] ways to [benefit]"

**Personal/Story:**
- "Quick story about [topic]"
- "What happened when I [action]"

**Question:**
- "Can I ask you something?"
- "Are you making this mistake?"

**Pattern Interrupt:**
- "." (just a period)
- "So..."
- "Bad news"

### What Kills Opens

- ALL CAPS
- Excessive punctuation!!!
- "Newsletter #47"
- "[COMPANY NAME] Weekly Update"
- Clickbait that doesn't deliver

## Email Copy Principles

### P.S. Is Prime Real Estate
40% read P.S. first. Use for: core CTA, second hook, deadline reminder.

### One CTA Per Email
Multiple CTAs = no CTAs. Every email drives ONE action.

### Short Paragraphs
1-3 sentences max. Email is scanned, not read.

### Preview Text Matters
First 40-90 characters appear in inbox preview.

### Specificity Creates Credibility
- Not "made money" → "$47,329 in one day"
- Not "many customers" → "2,847 customers"
- Not "recently" → "Last Tuesday"

## Timing Guidelines

### When to Start Selling

| Price Point | Value Emails First |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Low (<$100) | 3-5 emails |
| Medium ($100-500) | 5-7 emails |
| High (>$500) | 7-10 emails or call |

Trust required scales with price.

### Best Send Times
- B2B: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am recipient time
- B2C: Tuesday-Thursday, 7-9am or 7-9pm
- Avoid: Monday morning, Friday afternoon

## Output Format

```markdown
# [Sequence Name] — [Product/Offer]

## Sequence Goal
[What this accomplishes]

## Timing
[Send schedule]

## Quality Test

A good sequence:

1. **Delivers value before asking** — 3-5 value emails before pitch
2. **Has clear purpose per email** — Each email does ONE job
3. **Sounds human** — Not corporate, not guru, not AI
4. **Creates momentum** — Each email makes them want the next
5. **Handles objections** — Addresses "but..." before they think it
6. **Has one CTA** — Every email drives one action
7. **Respects the reader** — Easy to unsubscribe, not manipulative
