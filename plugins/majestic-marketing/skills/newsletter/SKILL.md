# Newsletter Architect

Create compelling newsletter editions that readers actually open, read, and forward.

## Newsletter vs Email Nurture

| Newsletter (this skill) | Email Nurture |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Ongoing communication | One-time sequences |
| Regular cadence (weekly/monthly) | Triggered by action |
| Curated + original content | Focused drip campaign |
| Builds relationship over time | Moves toward conversion |
| Subscribers expect it | Automated based on behavior |

## Conversation Starter

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather context:

"I'll help you create a newsletter edition that readers will love.

**Quick info needed:**

1. **Newsletter name/topic**: What's your newsletter about?
2. **Archetype** (pick one):
   - **Curator** - Curate the best links/resources (like Morning Brew)
   - **Educator** - Teach one thing deeply (like James Clear)
   - **Thought Leader** - Share opinions/insights (like Lenny's Newsletter)
   - **Hybrid** - Mix of above
3. **This edition's focus**: What's the main topic/theme?
4. **Cadence**: Weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly?
5. **Tone**: Casual, professional, witty, etc.
6. **Any specific content to include?** (links, announcements, stories)

I'll draft your edition with subject line options."

### Power Words for Opens

- "Quick" - signals low commitment
- "Real" - signals authenticity

### Words to Avoid

- "Don't miss" - overused
- "Exciting news" - generic hype

## Content Sourcing

### For Curators

**Where to find links:**
- Twitter/X lists of industry experts
- Hacker News, Reddit niche subs
- Industry Slack/Discord communities
- Pocket/Instapaper saved articles
- Google Alerts on key topics
- Competitor newsletters (add value, don't copy)

**Curation criteria:**
- Would I send this to a smart friend?
- Does it teach something actionable?
- Is it fresh (not everyone has seen it)?
- Does it fit my audience's level?

### For Educators

**Content mining:**
- Questions from readers/customers
- Mistakes you've made
- Processes that work for you
- Books you're reading (one insight per newsletter)
- Conversations that sparked ideas

### For Thought Leaders

**Opinion generators:**
- What common practice do you disagree with?
- What do beginners get wrong?
- What changed your mind recently?
- What would you do differently knowing what you know now?

## Quality Checklist

Before sending, verify:

- [ ] Subject line creates curiosity (would YOU open it?)
- [ ] First line hooks immediately (no "hope you're well")
- [ ] One clear theme/focus (not a content dump)
- [ ] Scannable format (headers, bullets, short paragraphs)
- [ ] Personal voice (sounds like you, not corporate)
- [ ] Clear CTA (reply, forward, click, or just enjoy)
- [ ] Mobile-friendly (preview on phone)
- [ ] Proofread (typos kill trust)

## Integration

Works well with:
- `brand-voice` - Apply your documented voice
- `content-atomizer` - Turn newsletter into social posts
- `hook-writer` - Generate subject line options
- `copy-editor` - Polish before sending

**Workflow:**
```
Newsletter draft → brand-voice check → copy-editor polish → send
                                    → content-atomizer → social posts
```

## Frequency Guidelines

| Cadence | Best For | Reader Expectation |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Daily | News, markets, quick hits | <3 min read |
| Weekly | Deep dives, curated | 5-10 min read |
| Bi-weekly | Thought leadership | 7-15 min read |
| Monthly | Comprehensive roundups | 10-20 min read |

**Rule:** Don't send if you have nothing valuable. Silence > noise.
