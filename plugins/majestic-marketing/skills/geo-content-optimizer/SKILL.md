# GEO Content Optimizer

Content structure and framing for AI citation in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini.

## GEO vs Traditional SEO

| Aspect | Traditional SEO | GEO Focus |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Goal | Rank in blue links | Get cited in AI responses |
| Focus | Keywords + backlinks | Semantic depth + fact-density |
| Structure | Readable by humans | Extractable by AI |
| Authority | Domain authority | Citation quality + source reputation |

## Content Framing for AI Trust

AI is pattern-trained on authoritative content types. **Framing matters more than domain authority.**

**High-Trust Content Formats:**

| Format | AI Trust Level | Why It Works |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Research report | Very High | Trained on academic papers, industry reports |
| Comparative analysis | High | Matches evaluation/review patterns |
| Industry benchmark | High | Data-driven, authoritative framing |
| Expert roundup | Medium-High | Multiple credible sources |
| How-to guide | Medium | Utility content pattern |
| "Best X" listicle | Low | Associated with affiliate/promo content |

**Reframing Strategy:**

| Instead Of | Reframe As |
|------------|------------|
| "Best CRM Software 2024" | "CRM Industry Analysis: Feature Comparison Across 12 Platforms" |
| "Why Choose [Product]" | "Evaluation Framework: Key Criteria for [Category] Selection" |
| "Top 10 Tools for X" | "[Category] Landscape Report: Methodology-Based Assessment" |
| "Product Review" | "Comparative Analysis: [Product] in Context of Market Alternatives" |

**Research-Style Content Elements:**
- Executive summary / Key findings section
- Methodology explanation (how you evaluated)
- Data tables with citations
- Limitations acknowledgment
- Author credentials / analyst bio

## Content Structure for AI Extraction

**Paragraph Optimization:**
- Keep paragraphs under 120 words
- One idea per paragraph
- Lead with key facts
- Use clear topic sentences

**Extractable Formats:**
- TL;DR blocks at content start
- Bullet lists for features/steps
- Tables for comparisons
- Definition boxes for terms
- FAQ sections for direct answers

**Header Strategy:**
- Clear H2/H3 hierarchy
- Question-based headers (matches prompts)
- Topic-keyword alignment
- Semantic grouping

## Fact-Density Optimization

**High-Value Elements:**
- Statistics with sources
- Specific numbers and dates
- Verifiable data points
- Expert quotes with attribution
- Original research findings

**Information Gain Signals:**
- Unique insights not found elsewhere
- Novel perspectives on topics
- First-hand experience
- Comprehensive coverage
- Updated information

## The Taco Bell Test (Chunking)

Every section must make sense on its own WITHOUT reading sections before or after.

- Each chunk = independent, extractable unit
- AI may cite just one section; make it complete
- No "as mentioned above" references

## Speed Advantage

AI reacts to fresh, structured inputs faster than waiting for traditional authority signals. A well-framed research piece can gain AI visibility within hours, not months.
