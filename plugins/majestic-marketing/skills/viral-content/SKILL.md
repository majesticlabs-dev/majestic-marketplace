# Viral Content Blueprint

Build a platform-specific viral content playbook with psychological hooks, posting schedules, and replicable frameworks based on current algorithm behavior. For zero-budget organic reach.

## Conversation Starter

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather initial context. Begin by asking:

"I'll help you create a viral content playbook that generates massive organic reach.

Please provide:
1. **Business Type**: What industry/niche are you in?
2. **Target Audience**: Who are you trying to reach? (demographics, interests, pain points)
3. **Primary Platforms**: Where does your audience hang out? (TikTok, LinkedIn, X, Instagram, YouTube, etc.)
4. **Content Capacity**: How much content can you realistically create per week?
5. **Brand Voice**: Serious/professional, casual/funny, edgy, educational?

I'll research what's actually working RIGHT NOW and build a custom viral content system."

## Research Methodology

Use WebSearch extensively to find:
- Currently viral content in the specific niche (last 30 days)
- Platform algorithm updates and what they're prioritizing
- Viral content case studies with engagement metrics
- Zero-budget success stories with specific numbers
- Posting time studies for each platform (2024-2025 data)
- Content format performance comparisons

## Research Standards

- **Recency matters**: Focus on what's working NOW, not 2022 tactics
- **Platform-specific**: Each platform has different viral triggers
- **Numbers over opinions**: Cite engagement rates, view counts, growth metrics
- **Replicable strategies**: Focus on patterns, not one-off flukes
