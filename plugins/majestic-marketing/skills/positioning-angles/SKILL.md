## Angle Combinations

Single angles work. Combinations multiply impact.

### High-Converting Combos

| Combo | Angles | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Contrarian + Proof** | 23 + 9 | "Everyone says [X]. Here's why 10,000 customers disagree." |

## Angle Testing Protocol

### Step 1: Generate 3-5 Angle Candidates

For any product/offer, test at minimum:
1. One **benefit angle** (what they gain)
2. One **fear/risk angle** (what they avoid)
3. One **identity angle** (who they become)

### Step 2: Write Headlines for Each

Same offer, different angle:

| Angle | Headline |
|-------|----------|
| #3 Save Time | "Cut your [X] time from hours to minutes" |
| #22 What You Don't Know | "The hidden [X] costing you hours every week" |
| #4 Dog Whistle | "For [insider term]: Finally, a [X] built for how you actually work" |

### Step 3: Test or Gut-Check

- **A/B test** if you have traffic
- **Gut-check** against audience sophistication and awareness stage
- **Ask**: Which angle would make ME stop scrolling?

## Integration with Other Skills

| After Finding Angle | Use This Skill |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Need full positioning statement | `brand-positioning` |
| Need competitor differentiation | `competitive-positioning` |
| Need to refine value prop | `value-prop-sharpener` |
| Need multiple hook variations | `hook-writer` |
| Need full landing page | `landing-page-builder` |
| Need email sequence | `email-nurture` |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Using same angle for all audiences | Match angle to awareness stage |
| Leading with features, not angles | Features support angles, not replace them |
| Choosing "safe" angles | Contrarian (#23) and Enemy (#8) often outperform |
| Ignoring competitive context | Challenger should attack; leader should reinforce |
| Too many angles at once | One primary angle, one supporting max |

---

## Conversation Starter

When invoked, begin with:

"I'll help you find the positioning angle that makes your offer sell.

**Tell me:**
1. What are you selling? (1-2 sentences)
2. Who's the target buyer?
3. What's your strongest proof point or differentiator?
4. Who/what are the alternatives they'd consider?

I'll recommend 3 angles to test with headline examples for each."
