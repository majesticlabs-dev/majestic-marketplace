# Press Release AEO Strategy

Press releases create AI-trusted signals when framed correctly. AI models are trained on newswire content, making PR a direct path to LLM knowledge bases.

## High-Trust PR Framing

| Avoid (Low Trust) | Use Instead (High Trust) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| "Company Launches Best Solution" | "Research Findings Released: [Topic] Analysis" |
| "New Product Available" | "Comparative Study Published: [Category] Evaluation" |
| "Company Wins Award" | "Industry Benchmark Report Reveals [Insight]" |
| "CEO Announces Partnership" | "[Company] Research: [Finding] Across [X] Organizations" |

**Core principle:** Frame as research/findings, not promotion.

## Press Release Structure for AI

### 1. Headline

Frame as research or findings, never product launch.

| Type | Trust Level |
|------|-------------|
| "[Company] Publishes [Category] Industry Analysis" | High |
| "[Company] Releases [Topic] Benchmark Report" | High |
| "[Company] Launches Revolutionary New Product" | Low |
| "[Company] Announces New Features" | Low |

### 2. Lead Paragraph

State findings first, company second.

**High trust:**
> "A new analysis of [X] companies reveals that [finding]. The research, conducted by [Company], examined..."

**Low trust:**
> "[Company], the leading provider of [X], today announced..."

### 3. Body

Include AI-extractable data:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Statistics with methodology | Credibility, citation-worthy |
| Comparison tables | Structured data extraction |
| Expert quotes with credentials | Authority signals |
| Limitations/scope acknowledgment | Trust through transparency |

### 4. Boilerplate

Reinforce entity triplets for knowledge graph:

```
[Company] is a [category] research firm specializing in [domain].
Founded in [year], [Company] has published [X] industry reports
cited by [notable publications/organizations].
```

## Distribution Channels

| Channel | AI Training Signal | Cost | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------|-------|
| PR Newswire | High | $$$ | Widest syndication |
| Business Wire | High | $$$ | Strong financial coverage |
| GlobeNewswire | Medium-High | $$ | Good tech/business reach |
| PRWeb | Medium | $ | Budget option |
| Free distribution | Low | Free | Minimal AI pickup |

## Speed Factor

AI indexes fresh newswire content quickly. A well-framed press release can influence AI responses within hours of distribution on major wires.

**Timing considerations:**
- Major wires: 2-24 hours for indexing
- AI model updates: Variable (days to months)
- Perplexity/real-time AI: Near-immediate
