# Topical Authority

Frameworks for building topical authority and measuring coverage dominance.

## Authority Score Formula

```
Authority Score = (Topic Coverage %) × (Content Age Factor) × (Depth Multiplier)
```

### Topic Coverage %

| Coverage | Status | Strategy |
|----------|--------|----------|
| 0-30% | Emerging | Focus on core topics first |
| 30-60% | Developing | Fill major gaps systematically |
| 60-80% | Authoritative | Target long-tail and edge topics |
| 80%+ | Dominant | Maintain freshness, add depth |

### Content Age Factor

| Age | Factor | Action |
|-----|--------|--------|
| Fresh (0-3 months) | 1.0x | Maintain quality |
| Recent (3-6 months) | 0.9x | Monitor for updates needed |
| Aging (6-12 months) | 0.8x | Refresh with new data |
| Stale (12+ months) | 0.6x | Major update or consolidate |

### Depth Multiplier

| Depth Level | Words | Multiplier | Content Type |
|-------------|-------|------------|--------------|
| Shallow | <500 | 0.5x | Definitions, news |
| Standard | 500-1500 | 1.0x | How-tos, guides |
| Deep | 1500-3000 | 1.2x | Comprehensive guides |
| Exhaustive | 3000+ | 1.5x | Pillar content, research |

## Topic Mapping Process

### Step 1: Identify Core Topics

List all topics in your domain:
- Main categories (5-10)
- Subcategories per category (10-20 each)
- Long-tail variations (50-100 per subcategory)

### Step 2: Audit Coverage

| Topic | Your Content | Competitor A | Competitor B | Gap |
|-------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| [Topic 1] | Yes/No/Partial | Y/N/P | Y/N/P | Priority |
| [Topic 2] | | | | |

### Step 3: Calculate Authority

```
Your Topics Covered: X
Total Topics in Domain: Y
Coverage %: X/Y × 100

Weighted Score = Σ(Coverage × Age × Depth) for each topic
```

## Topic Cluster Structure

```
PILLAR PAGE (Exhaustive, 3000+ words)
├── Cluster 1: [Subtopic]
│   ├── Supporting Article A
│   ├── Supporting Article B
│   └── Supporting Article C
├── Cluster 2: [Subtopic]
│   ├── Supporting Article D
│   └── Supporting Article E
└── Cluster 3: [Subtopic]
    └── Supporting Article F

Internal Links: Spokes → Hub → Spokes
```

## Competitor Comparison

| Metric | You | Comp A | Comp B | Gap Analysis |
|--------|-----|--------|--------|--------------|
| Total topics covered | | | | |
| Avg content depth | | | | |
| Update frequency | | | | |
| Backlink domains | | | | |
| Author credentials | | | | |

### Finding Competitor Topics

1. Crawl their sitemap for content inventory
2. Analyze top 50 pages by traffic
3. Map their topic clusters
4. Identify topics they rank for that you don't

## Content Gap Analysis

| Gap Type | Indicators | Priority |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Missing topic | Competitor ranks, you don't | High |
| Shallow coverage | Your content < 500 words | High |
| Outdated | No update in 12+ months | Medium |
| Missing format | They have video, you don't | Medium |
| Weak depth | Your content less comprehensive | Medium |
