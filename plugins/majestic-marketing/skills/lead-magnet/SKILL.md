# Lead Magnet Builder

Create lead magnets that people actually want—and that convert visitors into subscribers.

## What Makes a Great Lead Magnet

| Criteria | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Specific** | Solves ONE problem, not everything |
| **Quick win** | Delivers value in <10 minutes |
| **Actionable** | They can DO something with it |
| **Relevant** | Attracts your ideal customer |
| **High perceived value** | Looks worth giving email for |

## The Three Principles

### 1. The Specificity Principle

**Narrow beats broad. Every time.**

"5-Step Framework to Land Your First 10 Clients in 30 Days (Even If You Hate Networking)" converts dramatically better than "Marketing Guide for Freelancers."

When generating concepts, push toward:
- Specific outcome (not "grow your business" but "add $10k MRR")
- Specific timeframe (not "eventually" but "in 30 days")
- Specific audience (not "entrepreneurs" but "B2B SaaS founders")
- Specific method (not "marketing tips" but "The LinkedIn DM Framework")

### 2. The Bridge Principle

**The lead magnet must logically connect to the paid offer.**

If someone downloads a lead magnet about Instagram growth and you sell SEO services, there's no bridge.

The best lead magnets are "Step 1" of what you sell:
- Course on copywriting → Lead magnet: "The Headline Formula" (first skill)
- Agency doing SEO audits → Lead magnet: Free mini-audit (demonstrates full audit)
- Coach on productivity → Lead magnet: "Morning Routine Builder" (taste of methodology)

The bridge should be obvious: "If you liked this free thing, the paid thing is more/deeper/complete."

### 3. The Quick Win Principle

**Solve one specific problem completely.**

The best lead magnets deliver immediate value:
- A checklist they complete in 10 minutes that reveals gaps
- A template they customize in an hour for their business
- An assessment that gives them a score and action items immediately
- A calculator that shows their specific numbers right now

Quick wins create reciprocity.

## Conversation Starter

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather context:

"I'll help you create a lead magnet that converts.

**Tell me:**

1. **Business/Niche**: What do you sell or teach?
2. **Target audience**: Who are you trying to attract?
3. **Biggest pain point**: What's their #1 struggle?
4. **Your expertise**: What can you help with quickly?
5. **Lead magnet type** (pick one):
   - **Checklist** - Step-by-step verification list
   - **Template** - Fill-in-the-blank document
   - **Swipe file** - Collection of examples to copy
   - **Mini-guide** - Short how-to (5-10 pages)
   - **Cheat sheet** - Quick reference one-pager
   - **Toolkit** - Bundle of resources
   - **Quiz** - Interactive assessment
   - **Calculator** - Solve a math problem for them

I'll create the content plus landing page copy."
