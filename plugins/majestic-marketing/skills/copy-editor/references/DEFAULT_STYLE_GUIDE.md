# Default Style Guide

A comprehensive style guide for professional business writing. These rules provide sensible defaults when no project-specific style guide exists.


## 1. Grammar & Mechanics

### 1.1 Punctuation

#### Commas

- **Oxford comma**: Always use the serial comma before "and" or "or" in lists of three or more items.
  - Correct: "We offer design, development, and marketing services."
  - Incorrect: "We offer design, development and marketing services."

- **Introductory phrases**: Use a comma after introductory phrases of four or more words.
  - Correct: "After completing the onboarding process, users can access all features."
  - Correct: "First, click the button." (shorter phrases are flexible)

- **Compound sentences**: Use a comma before coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, nor, for, yet, so) joining independent clauses.
  - Correct: "The feature is powerful, but it requires configuration."

#### Semicolons

- Use semicolons to join closely related independent clauses without a conjunction.
  - Correct: "The API is RESTful; all endpoints follow standard conventions."
- Use semicolons in complex lists where items contain commas.
  - Correct: "Our offices are in Austin, Texas; Portland, Oregon; and Miami, Florida."

#### Colons

- Use colons to introduce lists, explanations, or examples.
  - Correct: "The platform supports three languages: English, Spanish, and French."
- Capitalize the first word after a colon only if it begins a complete sentence.

#### Em Dashes

- Use em dashes (—) without spaces to set off parenthetical information or for emphasis.
  - Correct: "The new feature—available to all users—launches Monday."
- Limit to two em dashes per sentence maximum.

#### Hyphens

- **Compound modifiers**: Hyphenate compound modifiers before a noun.
  - Correct: "real-time updates," "user-friendly interface"
  - No hyphen after: "The interface is user friendly."
- **Prefixes**: Generally no hyphen (nonprofit, reenter, coworker) unless it aids readability (co-owner, re-sign vs. resign).
- **Suspended hyphens**: "full- and part-time employees"

#### Apostrophes

- **Possessives**: Add 's for singular nouns, including those ending in s.
  - Correct: "the company's policy," "James's report"
- **Plural possessives**: Add apostrophe after the s.
  - Correct: "the users' preferences," "the companies' earnings"
- **Its vs. It's**: "Its" is possessive; "it's" means "it is."

#### Quotation Marks

- Periods and commas go inside quotation marks.
- Colons and semicolons go outside quotation marks.
- Question marks and exclamation points go inside if part of the quote, outside if not.

### 1.2 Capitalization

#### Titles and Headings

- **Headlines**: Use Title Case for main headlines and page titles.
  - Correct: "How to Improve Your Marketing Strategy"
- **Subheadings**: Use Sentence case for subheadings and section headers.
  - Correct: "Getting started with the dashboard"

#### Job Titles

- Lowercase job titles unless they directly precede a name.
  - Correct: "CEO Jane Smith announced..." / "Jane Smith, chief executive officer, announced..."
  - Correct: "Talk to your account manager." (generic reference)

#### Product Names

- Capitalize official product names and features.
  - Correct: "Use the Analytics Dashboard to track performance."
- Lowercase generic references.
  - Correct: "The dashboard shows your metrics."

#### After Colons

- Capitalize the first word after a colon only if it's a complete sentence or a formal statement.

### 1.3 Numbers

#### Spelling Out vs. Numerals

- **Spell out**: Numbers one through nine.
  - Correct: "We have three pricing tiers."
- **Use numerals**: Numbers 10 and above.
  - Correct: "The report contains 15 charts."
- **Exception**: Always use numerals for:
  - Measurements (5 MB, 3 inches)
  - Percentages (5%, not five percent)
  - Money ($5, $1.5 million)
  - Time (3 p.m., 9:30 a.m.)
  - Dates (January 5, 2024)
  - Version numbers (version 2.0)

#### Large Numbers

- Use numerals with words for large round numbers.
  - Correct: "5 million users," "$2.5 billion"
- Use commas for numbers 1,000 and above.
  - Correct: "10,000 customers"

#### Percentages

- Use numerals with the % symbol.
  - Correct: "Revenue increased 25%."
- Spell out "percent" in casual content if preferred for readability.

#### Dates and Times

- **Dates**: Month Day, Year format.
  - Correct: "January 15, 2024"
  - Avoid: "1/15/24" or "15 January 2024"
- **Times**: Use lowercase a.m. and p.m. with periods.
  - Correct: "The webinar starts at 2 p.m. EST."
- **Time zones**: Spell out on first reference, abbreviate after.

### 1.4 Abbreviations and Acronyms

#### First Reference

- Spell out on first use, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses.
  - Correct: "The application programming interface (API) enables integration."
- After first reference, use the abbreviation alone.

#### Common Exceptions

- Very common abbreviations need no expansion: URL, PDF, HTML, CEO, FAQ.

#### Periods

- No periods in acronyms: "US" not "U.S.", "CEO" not "C.E.O."
- Exception: "U.S." is acceptable when used as an adjective.


## 2. Voice & Tone

### 2.1 Active Voice

#### Prefer Active Voice

- Active voice is clearer, more direct, and more engaging.
  - Active: "The team completed the project."
  - Passive: "The project was completed by the team."

#### When Passive Is Acceptable

- When the actor is unknown or unimportant: "The data was collected automatically."
- When emphasizing the action over the actor: "Your account has been upgraded."
- In scientific or technical contexts where convention dictates.

### 2.2 Conciseness

#### Eliminate Filler Words

Remove words that add no meaning:

| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| "in order to" | "to" |
| "due to the fact that" | "because" |
| "at this point in time" | "now" |
| "in the event that" | "if" |

### 2.3 Clarity

#### One Idea Per Sentence

- Break complex sentences into shorter ones.
- Aim for 15-20 words per sentence on average.
- Vary sentence length for rhythm, but avoid sentences over 30 words.

#### Avoid Jargon

- Use plain language unless writing for technical audiences.
- If jargon is necessary, define it on first use.
- Replace corporate buzzwords with concrete language:

| Buzzword | Plain Language |
|----------|----------------|
| "leverage" | "use" |
| "synergy" | "collaboration" or specify |
| "paradigm shift" | "change" or specify |
| "circle back" | "follow up" |

| "move the needle" | "make progress" |
| "low-hanging fruit" | "easy wins" |

### 2.4 Inclusive Language

#### Gender-Neutral Language

  - Correct: "Each user can customize their dashboard."
- Avoid gendered job titles: "firefighter" not "fireman," "chairperson" not "chairman."

## 3. Formatting

### 3.1 Headings

- Make headings descriptive and scannable

### 3.2 Lists

#### Bulleted Lists

- Use for unordered items where sequence doesn't matter.
- Start each item with a capital letter.
- Use parallel structure (all items same grammatical form).
- If items are complete sentences, end with periods.
- If items are fragments, no end punctuation.

#### Numbered Lists

- Use when sequence matters or when referring to specific items.
- Use for step-by-step instructions.
- Same capitalization and punctuation rules as bulleted lists.

#### Parallel Structure

Correct:
- Design the interface
- Develop the backend
- Test the integration

Incorrect:
- Interface design
- Developing the backend
- To test the integration

### 3.3 Links

#### Descriptive Anchor Text

- Use 2-5 words that describe the destination.
  - Correct: "Read our [pricing guide] for details."

Never use as link text:

- "Here"
- Raw URLs (unless necessary for print)

### 3.4 Emphasis

#### Bold

- Use for key terms on first introduction.
- Use for UI elements: "Click **Submit** to continue."

#### Italics

- Use for titles of books, publications, and media.
- Use for introducing technical terms (first use only).
- Use for emphasis when bold would be too strong.

#### Avoid

- ALL CAPS for emphasis (reads as shouting).
- Underlines for emphasis (confused with links).
- Combining bold and italics.


## 4. Word Choice

### 4.1 Commonly Confused Words

| Word | Meaning | Example |

### 4.2 Words to Avoid

- "state-of-the-art"

#### Hedging Language

Be confident (where appropriate):
- Instead of "We believe..." use direct statements.

- Instead of "Might possibly..." use "may" or commit.

### 4.3 AI Writing Tells

AI-generated text has recognizable patterns. Avoid them to sound human.

#### Quick Rules

- **No vocabulary clusters**: Words like "delve", "landscape", "pivotal", "robust" signal AI when clustered
- **No formulaic phrases**: "In today's landscape...", "In conclusion...", "It's important to note..."
- **No vague attributions**: "Some experts believe...", "Widely regarded as..." without specific sources
- **No essay structure**: Broad thematic openings + mechanical transitions + summative conclusions

### 4.4 Technical vs. Plain Language

#### When to Simplify

For general audiences:

- "end" not "terminate"
- "help" not "facilitate"
- "about" not "approximately"
- "show" not "demonstrate"
- "try" not "attempt"
- "need" not "require" (when informal)

#### When Technical Is Appropriate

| Example | for example, specifically, for instance |
