# Thread Builder

Structure content into engaging Twitter/X threads that hold attention and drive engagement.

## Thread Anatomy

Every high-performing thread follows this structure:

```
Tweet 1: HOOK (stop the scroll)
Tweet 2-3: SETUP (establish context/stakes)
Tweet 4-8: BODY (deliver value, escalate)
Tweet 9-10: CLIMAX (peak insight/revelation)
Tweet 11-12: CTA (action + engagement ask)
```

## Optimal Thread Length

| Thread Type | Length | Best For |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Quick insight | 5-7 tweets | Single concept, high shareability |
| How-to guide | 8-12 tweets | Tutorials, frameworks |
| Story thread | 10-15 tweets | Narratives, case studies |
| Deep dive | 15-20 tweets | Complex topics, research |

**Rule:** If you can't fill 8 tweets with value, it's a post, not a thread.

## Hook Formulas (Tweet 1)

The hook determines 80% of thread performance. Use these patterns:

### Curiosity Gap
```
I spent [X time] studying [topic].

Here's what nobody tells you:
```

### Contrarian
```
[Common belief] is wrong.

Here's what actually works:
```

### Story Open
```
[Time ago], I [was in bad situation].

Today, I [am in good situation].

Here's exactly what changed:
```

### Numbered Promise
```
[X] [unexpected adjective] ways to [achieve result].

(Most people only know #3)
```

### Before/After
```
[X months] ago: [bad state]
Today: [good state]

The [X]-step system that changed everything:
```

### Social Proof
```
This [thing] helped me [specific result].

[Specific number/metric] later, here's the breakdown:
```

## Tweet-by-Tweet Structure

### Tweet 1: The Hook
- First line is everything (appears in preview)
- Use line breaks for rhythm
- End with colon or "Here's..." to create pull

### Tweet 2: The Stakes
- Why this matters to the reader
- What they'll gain by reading
- Or: Context that amplifies the hook

```
Example:
"This isn't theory. I've tested this on [X] campaigns.

The difference: [specific metric improvement]"
```

### Tweets 3-8: The Body
Each tweet should:
- Make ONE clear point
- Include a specific example or number
- End with momentum into next tweet

**Momentum Patterns:**
- "But here's where it gets interesting..."
- "The real secret?"
- "Most people stop here. Don't."
- "Here's what I mean:"
- "Example:"

### Tweet 9-10: The Climax
- Deliver the core insight
- This is the "aha" moment
- Most quotable/screenshottable tweet

```
Example:
"The truth nobody talks about:

[Counterintuitive insight]

This single shift [specific result]."
```

### Tweet 11-12: The CTA
Layer your CTAs:

**Tweet 11 - Soft CTA:**
```
If this helped, I share [topic] threads every [day].

Follow @handle so you don't miss them.
```

**Tweet 12 - Engagement CTA:**
```
What's your biggest challenge with [topic]?

Drop it below - I'll respond to everyone.
```

## Thread Arc Patterns

### The Listicle Arc
```
1. Hook with number promise
2. Why this matters
3. Item 1 (strongest)
4. Item 2
5. Item 3
6. Item 4
7. Item 5 (second strongest)
8. Bonus item (unexpected)
9. Key takeaway
10. CTA
```

### The Story Arc
```
1. Hook (dramatic moment)
2. Context (where I was)
3. The problem
4. First attempt (failed)
5. What I learned
6. The breakthrough
7. The result
8. Key lesson 1
9. Key lesson 2
10. CTA + question
```

### The Framework Arc
```
1. Hook (promise the framework)
2. Why most approaches fail
3. The framework overview
4. Step 1 (with example)
5. Step 2 (with example)
6. Step 3 (with example)
7. Common mistake to avoid
8. Advanced tip
9. Results you can expect
10. CTA
```

### The Myth-Busting Arc
```
1. Hook (controversial take)
2. The common belief
3. Why people believe it
4. The evidence against
5. What actually works (part 1)
6. What actually works (part 2)
7. Case study/example
8. The real insight
9. How to apply this
10. CTA
```

## Cliffhanger Patterns

Keep readers scrolling with these tweet endings:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| The Tease | "But that's not even the best part..." |
| The Question | "So what happened next?" |
| The Contradiction | "Turns out, I was completely wrong." |
| The Promise | "Here's where it gets good:" |
| The Number | "Result? [Specific metric]" |
| The Challenge | "Most people won't do this. Will you?" |

## Formatting Rules

### Line Breaks
- Use single line breaks between thoughts
- Double line breaks for emphasis
- Never wall-of-text a tweet

**Bad:**
```
Here's why most people fail at X. They don't understand that Y is actually more important than Z. The research shows that...
```

**Good:**
```
Here's why most people fail at X:

They focus on Y.

But Z is what actually matters.

The research proves it:
```

### Numbers and Specificity
- "A lot of money" → "$47,000"
- "Recently" → "Last Tuesday"
- "Many people" → "2.3 million users"
- "Improved results" → "47% higher conversion"

### Emoji Usage
- One emoji per tweet maximum
- Use for visual breaks, not decoration
- Best at start of lists or sections

## Thread Types by Goal

| Goal | Thread Type | Key Elements |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Grow followers | Educational how-to | Actionable tips, follow CTA |
| Build authority | Deep analysis | Data, unique insight, contrarian take |
| Drive engagement | Story thread | Emotion, cliffhangers, question CTA |
| Generate leads | Framework thread | Free resource in final tweet |
| Viral reach | Listicle | Shareable insights, save-worthy |

## Anti-Patterns

**Don't:**
- Start tweet 1 with "Thread:" or "1/"
- Number every tweet (only if listicle)
- End tweets mid-sentence to force clicks
- Use more than one CTA type
- Make tweets dependent on previous (each should standalone)
- Pad with filler tweets

**Do:**
- Write tweet 1 as if it's the only tweet people will see
- Make every tweet valuable on its own
- Use the last tweet to encourage retweets of tweet 1
- Schedule threads for optimal times (8am, 12pm, 5pm local)

## Output Format

When building a thread, present as:

```markdown
## Thread: [Topic]

**Thread Type:** [Listicle/Story/Framework/Myth-Busting]
**Length:** [X] tweets
