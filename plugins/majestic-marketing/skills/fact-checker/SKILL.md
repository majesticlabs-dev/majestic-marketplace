# Fact Checker

Verify factual claims in marketing content and return an accuracy score with source citations.

## What to Verify

| Claim Type | Example | Verification Method |
|------------|---------|---------------------|
| Statistics | "85% of marketers use AI" | WebSearch for source |
| Metrics | "Saves 10 hours/week" | Look for case studies |
| Quotes | "As Forbes reported..." | Verify quote exists |
| Comparisons | "Fastest in the industry" | Check competitor data |
| Awards/Recognition | "Award-winning platform" | Verify award exists |
| Dates/Events | "Founded in 2015" | Cross-reference sources |

## What NOT to Verify

- Opinions ("We believe...")
- Subjective claims ("Beautiful design")
- Future projections ("Will transform...")
- Internal metrics without external validation

## Process

1. **Extract Claims**
   - Parse content for factual statements
   - Identify statistics, percentages, quotes, comparisons
   - Flag superlatives ("best", "fastest", "only")

2. **Categorize**
   - **Verifiable**: Has a specific, checkable assertion
   - **Opinion**: Subjective, not fact-checkable
   - **Vague**: Could be verified if made specific

3. **Verify via WebSearch**
   - Search for authoritative sources
   - Prioritize: official reports, academic sources, reputable publications
   - Check recency of data

4. **Score Each Claim**
   - **Verified**: Found supporting source
   - **Unverified**: No source found, but not contradicted
   - **Contradicted**: Found conflicting information
   - **Outdated**: Data exists but is stale
   - **Opinion**: Not fact-checkable

5. **Calculate Overall Score**
   - Score = (Verified + 0.5 x Unverified) / Total Verifiable Claims x 10

## Output Format

```markdown
## Fact Check Report: [Content Title/Description]

**Overall Accuracy Score:** X/10
**Claims Analyzed:** X total (X verifiable, X opinions)

### Claim Analysis

| # | Claim | Type | Status | Source | Action |
|---|-------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | "85% of marketers..." | Stat | Verified | [HubSpot 2024] | Add citation |
| 2 | "Best solution..." | Opinion | N/A | - | OK as-is |
| 3 | "Saves 10 hours" | Metric | Unverified | - | Add case study |
| 4 | "Founded 2015" | Fact | Contradicted | Was 2016 | Correct date |

### High-Risk Claims

Claims that need immediate attention:

1. **[Claim]** - [Why it's risky] - [Recommended fix]

### Recommendations

**To improve accuracy score:**
1. Add citations for unverified statistics
2. Soften absolute claims ("best" -> "leading")
3. Update outdated data points
4. Remove or rephrase contradicted claims

**Legal/Compliance Notes:**
- [Any claims that could trigger FTC/advertising concerns]
```

## Scoring Rubric

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Excellent - All major claims verified with sources |
| 7-8 | Good - Most claims verified, minor gaps |
| 5-6 | Fair - Mix of verified and unverified claims |
| 3-4 | Poor - Many unverified or contradicted claims |
| 1-2 | Critical - Major factual issues found |

## Source Quality Hierarchy

Prefer sources in this order:

1. **Primary sources** - Original research, official reports
2. **Authoritative publications** - Industry reports, academic papers
3. **Reputable media** - Major publications (Forbes, WSJ, NYT)
4. **Industry sources** - Trade publications, analyst reports
5. **Company sources** - Press releases, official statements

Avoid: blogs, forums, Wikipedia (use as starting point only)

## Special Attention

**FTC/Advertising Compliance:**
- Testimonials must be genuine and typical
- "Free" claims must have no hidden costs
- Comparisons must be substantiated
- Health/financial claims need strong evidence

**Common Marketing Claim Patterns:**
- "Studies show..." -> Which studies? Link them
- "Experts agree..." -> Which experts? Quote them
- "Industry-leading..." -> By what measure?
- "#1 rated..." -> By whom? When?
