## Text Post: The Story Arc

```
[Hook: 1-2 lines that stop scroll]

[Setup: What happened/the problem - 2-3 short lines]

[Turning point: The insight or change - 2-3 lines]

[The lesson: What you learned]
↳ Point 1
↳ Point 2
↳ Point 3

[CTA: Engagement driver - 1 line]
```

**Example:**
```
I got fired from my dream job at 32.

No warning. No severance. Just a "we're going in a different direction."

I spent 3 months feeling sorry for myself.

Then I realized something that changed everything:
↳ The best opportunities come from the worst moments
↳ Your network is your net worth (I had ignored mine for years)
↳ Job security is an illusion—skill security is real

What's the worst thing that happened to you that turned out to be a blessing?
```

What's the most important skill for new managers?

🗣️ Communication
📊 Strategic thinking
🤝 Delegation
💬 Other (comment below)

My take: Communication, but not the way most people think.

It's not about giving clear instructions.
It's about creating psychological safety so your team tells you the truth.

What's worked for you?

## Hook Formulas

### Contrarian Professional
**Formula:** [Common belief] is wrong. Here's what I learned...
- "Networking events are a waste of time. Here's what actually builds relationships..."
- "Your resume doesn't matter. Here's what hiring managers actually look at..."

### Vulnerable Professionalism
**Formula:** I [failed/struggled with X]. Here's what changed...
- "I got rejected from 47 jobs before landing my dream role. Here's what I was doing wrong..."
- "My first year as a manager was a disaster. Here's the lesson that changed everything..."

### Insider Knowledge
**Formula:** After [impressive credential], I learned [counterintuitive insight]
- "After interviewing 200+ candidates, I noticed the #1 thing that gets resumes rejected..."
- "After 10 years in [industry], here's what nobody tells you about [topic]..."

### Data/Results
**Formula:** [Specific number] [specific result] in [timeframe]. Here's the exact system...
- "37 inbound leads in 30 days. Zero ads. Here's my LinkedIn strategy..."
- "We reduced hiring time by 60%. Here's the framework..."

### Pattern Interrupt
**Formula:** Stop [common action]. Do this instead...
- "Stop saying 'let me know if you have questions.' Say this instead..."
- "Stop posting on LinkedIn at 9am. Here's when you should actually post..."
