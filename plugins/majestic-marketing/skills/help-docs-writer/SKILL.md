# Help Documentation Writer

Create customer-facing help articles for product features. Bridges technical implementation with user-friendly documentation.

## Inputs

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather:

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Feature name** | Yes | What feature to document |
| **Target audience** | Yes | Technical level (beginner/intermediate/advanced) |
| **Output format** | No | `markdown` (default) or `html` |
| **Help center platform** | No | Zendesk, Intercom, Notion, GitBook, custom |

## Process

### 1. Feature Discovery

Search codebase for feature implementation:

```bash
# Find feature files
rg -l "feature_name" --type-add 'code:*.{rb,js,ts,py,jsx,tsx}'

# Find UI components
rg -l "FeatureName" src/ app/

# Find routes/endpoints
rg "feature" config/routes.rb app/controllers/
```

Extract:
- What the feature does (core functionality)
- User-facing entry points (buttons, menus, URLs)
- Configuration options
- Error states and edge cases

### 2. Structure the Article

Standard help article structure:

```
1. Title (action-oriented)
2. Overview (what + why, 2-3 sentences)
3. Prerequisites (if any)
4. Step-by-step instructions
5. Tips/best practices (optional)
6. Troubleshooting (common issues)
7. Related articles (links)
```

### 3. Write for Customers

**Language rules:**
- Second person ("you") throughout
- Present tense for instructions
- Active voice only
- No jargon — explain technical terms if unavoidable
- Short sentences (max 20 words)

**Instruction format:**
- Numbered steps for sequences
- One action per step
- Start each step with a verb
- Include what the user should see after each action

## Example Output

**Input:** Document the "Export to CSV" feature

**Output (Markdown):**

```markdown
# How to export your data to CSV

Download your data as a CSV file to use in spreadsheets or other tools.

## Before you start

- You need **Editor** or **Admin** permissions
- Exports include data from the last 90 days by default

## Steps

1. **Go to Reports**

   Click **Reports** in the left sidebar.

   ![Screenshot: Left sidebar with Reports highlighted]

2. **Select the data to export**

   Use the filters to narrow down your data. You can filter by:
   - Date range
   - User
   - Status

3. **Click Export**

   Click the **Export** button in the top right corner.

   ![Screenshot: Export button location]

4. **Choose CSV format**

   Select **CSV** from the dropdown menu.

5. **Download your file**

   Your browser will download a file named `export-[date].csv`.

## Tips

- Large exports (over 10,000 rows) may take a few minutes
- The CSV uses UTF-8 encoding — compatible with Excel, Google Sheets, and Numbers

## Troubleshooting

### The Export button is grayed out

You don't have permission to export. Ask an Admin to grant you Editor access.

### My export is missing data

Check your date range filter. The default is 90 days. Adjust it to include older data.

### The file won't open in Excel

The file may be too large. Try opening it in Google Sheets, or filter your export to reduce the size.
