# Email Sequences

Most lead magnets die in the inbox. Someone downloads your thing, gets one "here's your download" email, and never hears from you again. Or worse—blasted with "BUY NOW" before you've earned trust.

The gap between "opted in" and "bought" is where money is made or lost.

---

## Conversation Starter

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather context:

"I'll help you build an email sequence that converts.

**Tell me:**

1. **What's the lead magnet?** (What did they opt in for?)
2. **What's the paid offer?** (What are you eventually selling?)
3. **What's the price point?** (Affects trust-building needed)
4. **What's the bridge?** (How does free → paid make logical sense?)
5. **What sequence type?**
   - **Welcome** - After opt-in (5-7 emails)
   - **Nurture** - Build trust between sequences (4-6 emails)
   - **Conversion** - Sell the product (4-7 emails)
   - **Launch** - Time-bound campaign (6-10 emails)
   - **Re-engagement** - Win back cold subscribers (3-4 emails)

I'll create complete emails with subject lines, timing, and full copy."

## Sequence Types

| Sequence | Purpose | Length | When |
|----------|---------|--------|------|
| **Welcome** | Deliver value, build relationship | 5-7 emails | After opt-in |
| **Nurture** | Provide value, build trust | 4-6 emails | Between welcome and pitch |
| **Conversion** | Sell the product | 4-7 emails | Ready to pitch |
| **Launch** | Time-bound campaign | 6-10 emails | Product launch |
| **Re-engagement** | Win back cold subscribers | 3-4 emails | Inactive 30+ days |

---

## The Welcome Sequence (5-7 emails)

Most important sequence. First impressions compound.

### Framework: DELIVER → CONNECT → VALUE → BRIDGE

```
Email 1: DELIVER — Give them what they came for
Email 2: CONNECT — Share your story, build rapport
Email 3: VALUE — Teach something useful (quick win)
Email 4: VALUE — Teach something else (authority)
Email 5: BRIDGE — Show what's possible with more help
Email 6: SOFT PITCH — Introduce the offer gently
Email 7: DIRECT PITCH — Make the ask
```

### Email 1: Delivery (Immediately)

**Purpose:** Deliver lead magnet, set expectations, get micro-engagement.

**Subject formulas:**
- "[Lead magnet name] is inside"
- "Your [lead magnet] + quick start guide"
- "Here's [what they asked for]"

**Structure:**
```
[Greeting — keep it simple]
[Deliver the goods — link]
[Quick start — one action in 5 minutes]
[Set expectations — what emails coming]
[Micro-CTA — hit reply, answer a question]
[Sign off]
```

### Email 2: Connection (Day 2)

**Purpose:** Build rapport through vulnerability.

**Subject formulas:**
- "Why I created [lead magnet]"
- "The mistake that led to this"
- "Quick story about [topic]"

**Structure:**
```
[Story hook — specific moment]
[The struggle — what you went through]
[The insight — what you learned]
[Connection — how this relates to them]
[Soft forward reference — hint at tomorrow]
```

### Email 3-4: Value (Days 4, 6)

**Purpose:** Teach something useful, demonstrate expertise.

**Subject formulas:**
- "The [X] mistake everyone makes"
- "Try this: [specific tactic]"
- "What [person] discovered about [topic]"

**Structure:**
```
[Hook — insight or observation]
[The problem — what most people get wrong]
[The solution — what to do instead]
[Example or proof — show it working]
[Action step — what they can do now]
```

### Email 5: Bridge (Day 8)

**Purpose:** Show gap between current state and possibility.

**Subject formulas:**
- "You can [do X] now. But can you [do Y]?"
- "What [lead magnet] doesn't do"

**Structure:**
```
[Acknowledge progress — what they can now do]
[Reveal the gap — what they still can't do]
[Paint the picture — what's possible with full solution]
[Soft mention — the offer exists, no hard sell]
```

### Email 6: Soft Pitch (Day 10)

**Purpose:** Introduce offer properly, let them self-select.

**Subject formulas:**
- "The full system (if you want it)"
- "This isn't for everyone"

**Structure:**
```
[The offer — what it is, what's included]
[Who it's for — specific situations]
[Who it's NOT for — disqualification]
[Social proof — if available]
[Soft CTA — no urgency yet]
```

### Email 7: Direct Pitch (Day 12)

**Purpose:** Make the clear ask.

**Subject formulas:**
- "Last thing about [product]"
- "[Product] — yes or no?"

**Structure:**
```
[Direct opener — no buildup]
[Restate core value — one sentence]
[Handle remaining objection]
[Urgency — if real]
[Clear CTA]
```

---

## The Conversion Sequence (4-7 emails)

For when you're ready to pitch directly.

### Framework: OPEN → DESIRE → PROOF → OBJECTION → URGENCY → CLOSE

```
Email 1: Introduce offer, core promise
Email 2: Paint transformation, show the gap
Email 3: Testimonials, case studies, results
Email 4: Handle the biggest objection
Email 5: Why now matters (if authentic)
Email 6: Final push, clear CTA
Email 7: Last call (deadline if applicable)
```

**Timing:** Every 2 days (daily for launches)

---

## The Launch Sequence (6-10 emails)

For time-bound campaigns.

### Framework: SEED → OPEN → VALUE → PROOF → URGENCY → CLOSE

**Pre-Launch (1-2 emails):**
- Seed interest, build anticipation

**Cart Open (2-3 emails):**
- Announcement, full details
- Value deep-dive
- Social proof

**Mid-Launch (2-3 emails):**
- Objection handling
- Case study
- FAQ

**Cart Close (2-3 emails):**
- 48-hour warning
- 24-hour warning
- Last call

---

## The Re-engagement Sequence (3-4 emails)

For subscribers inactive 30+ days.

### Framework: PATTERN INTERRUPT → VALUE → DECISION

```
Email 1: Different subject style, acknowledge absence
Email 2: Pure value — best content, no ask
Email 3: Direct question — do you want to stay?
Email 4: Final — removing from list (creates urgency)
```

**Subject lines:**
- "Did I do something wrong?"
- "Should I stop emailing you?"
- "Breaking up is hard to do"
- "[First name], still there?"

---

## Subject Line Formulas

### What Gets Opens

**Curiosity Gap:**
- "The [X] mistake that cost me [Y]"
- "Why [surprising thing] works"
- "I was wrong about [topic]"

**Direct Benefit:**
- "How to [outcome] in [timeframe]"
- "[Number] ways to [benefit]"

**Personal/Story:**
- "Quick story about [topic]"
- "What happened when I [action]"

**Question:**
- "Can I ask you something?"
- "Are you making this mistake?"

**Pattern Interrupt:**
- "." (just a period)
- "So..."
- "Bad news"

### What Kills Opens

- ALL CAPS
- Excessive punctuation!!!
- "Newsletter #47"
- "[COMPANY NAME] Weekly Update"
- Clickbait that doesn't deliver

---

## Email Copy Principles

### P.S. Is Prime Real Estate
40% read P.S. first. Use for: core CTA, second hook, deadline reminder.

### One CTA Per Email
Multiple CTAs = no CTAs. Every email drives ONE action.

### Short Paragraphs
1-3 sentences max. Email is scanned, not read.

### Preview Text Matters
First 40-90 characters appear in inbox preview.

**Bad:** "Having trouble viewing this email?"
**Good:** [Continue the curiosity from subject]

### Specificity Creates Credibility
- Not "made money" → "$47,329 in one day"
- Not "many customers" → "2,847 customers"
- Not "recently" → "Last Tuesday"

---

## Timing Guidelines

### When to Start Selling

| Price Point | Value Emails First |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Low (<$100) | 3-5 emails |
| Medium ($100-500) | 5-7 emails |
| High (>$500) | 7-10 emails or call |

Trust required scales with price.

### Best Send Times
- B2B: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am recipient time
- B2C: Tuesday-Thursday, 7-9am or 7-9pm
- Avoid: Monday morning, Friday afternoon

---

## Output Format

**Workflow:**
```
lead-magnet → email-sequences → direct-response-copy principles → customer
```

## Quality Test

A good sequence:

1. **Delivers value before asking** — 3-5 value emails before pitch
2. **Has clear purpose per email** — Each email does ONE job
3. **Sounds human** — Not corporate, not guru, not AI
4. **Creates momentum** — Each email makes them want the next
5. **Handles objections** — Addresses "but..." before they think it
6. **Has one CTA** — Every email drives one action
7. **Respects the reader** — Easy to unsubscribe, not manipulative

If it feels like "content, content, content, BUY NOW BUY NOW" — it failed.
