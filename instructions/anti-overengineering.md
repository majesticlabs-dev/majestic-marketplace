## Avoid Overengineering

YAGNI, KISS, DRY - Start with the simplest solution that solves the problem.

- Only add complexity when explicitly requested or necessary
- Don't add features or "improvements" beyond what was asked
- Prefer simple parameter flags over complex configuration objects
- Don't create abstractions for one-time operations
- Don't repeat yourself - extract when you see actual duplication, not hypothetical
